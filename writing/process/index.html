          The more I’ve worked in product design with startups, the more I’ve
          realized there’s no real process to follow. Every challenge is
          different and you really never know what’s around the corner. But if I
          were to define my rough process for effectively shipping quality
          products, this would be it:
        </p>

        <hr />
        <section>
          <aside>
            <p>Research</p>
          </aside>
          <p>
            First, understand the problem, business goals, user pain points, and
            the target audience. This can include doing interviews internally
            with the team you're working with, or conducting user tests with
            existing customers. I'd work with a UX researcher to find the right
            users for a study.<br />
          </p>
          <aside>
            <p>Exploration</p>
          </aside>
          <p>
            Next, I explore possible solutions by brainstorming, sketching,
            chatting with other designers, reading about solutions others have
            come up with online (if applicable), then sometimes developing
            wireframes, but most importantly building a prototype.<br />
          </p>
          <aside>
            <p>Testing</p>
          </aside>
          <p>
            After I have a working prototype it's back to user testing. I think
            getting things in front of users as soon as you can is super
            important. Rapid iteration in this stage can be really helpful, but
            sometimes I'll do a full test and take all the findings and propose
            something new after fully digesting the feedback. After talking to
            users, I'd show the final solution to stakeholders and present the
            initial ideas, my way of getting there, user feedback, and my final
            proposal.<br />
          </p>
          <aside>
            <p>Launch</p>
          </aside>
          <p>
            Finally, using stakeholder and user feedback in combination with
            quantitative and qualitative data, we launch something and the
            process starts again from the beginning.
