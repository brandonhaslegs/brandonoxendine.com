          Day 4 — The day after my first day sleeping at work was rough. I was
          sure this wasn’t going to last. I had a miserable headache all day, my
          body was sore, and I knew this was all a bad idea that I was now
          forced into. I was a bad coworker that day, but I think it was excused
          because it was Monday. I also realized when I woke up that I left my
          computer in my rental car, which was at my temporary corporate
          apartment, so I tried hitching a ride there on a work-bound bus.
          Apparently they only go to work in the mornings, and don’t make round
          trips. I found that odd, but it was a good thing my car/house was
          here. I’d just drive that to my apartment and grab my laptop bag,
          drive my rental car back, since it does better in traffic (it doesn’t
          smoke), then get a bus from work back to my apartment that evening,
          and drive my other car/house back to work to sleep for the night. What
          a complicated scheme. It hurt my head to organize it, but it ended up
          working out. So now I had both of my cars at work. The rental car I
          had to return in a week though, so I wouldn’t have two cars in a week.
          And my apartment’s lease was up at the end of the month, so that would
          go away soon too. I’d soon have no choice but to live in my car. I
          decided to rent the temporary apartment place out on Airbnb in the
          meantime. Considering I was living in my car, I might as well make a
          few more bucks by doing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          That morning, I had to use the bathroom really badly, so looking for
          an outfit in my piles of mixed up clothes was not a pleasant
          experience. I needed to get my clothes organized. So I put my pants in
          one pile, my shirts in one pile, my underwear and socks in another
          pile, and threw all my coats into a final heap furthest from the trunk
          door, next to the passenger’s-side, back-right door, which doesn’t
          open, making it really convenient for shoving things up against it. I
          would need hangers for my nicer, button-down shirts, so I decided to
          make a run to Wal-mart on the way back to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I got to Wal-mart and parked, I noticed the car I parked next to
          was packed tight with clothes, a guitar, and lots of knick-knacks. It
          was a hard sight to see, and I immediately knew how wrong my
          experiment of being homeless could go. I’m not much of a collector,
          but I decided when I saw this that I couldn’t let my possessions get
          out of control, and needed to stay organized. I went inside, waded
          through far too many people for a Monday night, ended up browsing the
          camping section, where I picked up a knife because “You’ll get upset
          with yourself if you don’t have this when someone tries breaking in”,
          picked up some rope to tie my curtains back when not in use, searched
          forever but finally found a hole punch to secure the rope to the
          curtains, and got my hangers. I had 9 items so I stood in the 10 Items
          or Less line, and naturally was behind 2 people who both had far more
          than 10 items. They were scolded by the cashier, I bought my items,
          and hurried to my car to drive to work, to go to sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          I smelled bad, so I tried out the work showers for the first time. Not
          bad. And now I was freshly showered for the first time in four days,
          so that felt pretty good. And then I began night 2 of sleeping at
          work. I was much more at ease this night, since I had 2 aspirin a bit
          earlier, and I was generally more comfortable with sleeping in my car.
          I hung my nice shirts, checked every possible crack that someone could
          peak through, took off my clothes, and went to sleep, determined to
          sleep well this night.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did. I woke up exactly at nine o'clock in the morning, peed in a
          water bottle, picked out an outfit easily, opened the back left door
          (this is essentially my front door), and started on my 20-foot commute
          to work.
