      <h1>👋 L8R</h1>

      <p>
        Hey everyone, it’s Friday the 13th 👻 and you know what that means… it's
        my last day at Grover. 😐 Sad that we can’t all party together one last
        time, but I’ll come back on a Friday sometime after we've all come out
        of quarantine. 🦠
      </p>
      <p>
        It has certainly been a wild 3 years seeing the transformation that
        Grover has been through and I’m super proud of the work I did. Actually
        *pulls out notes, wipes one tear from eye* I was reflecting on the last
        few years and honestly more than things I did at Grover, I’m more proud
        when I think about the people I brought to Grover—people who are just so
        good and integral to the company at this point. Like check this out:
      </p>
      <p>
        - Martin leads user research and has totally transformed how we think
        about our users.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Erin leads the brand design team and has guided Grover through a
        chaotic few years of the Grover brand.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Jason, who started as a product design intern, now leads an incredible
        product team.
      </p>
      <p>- Claudia leads CS. I brought Julian here too. 😘</p>
      <p>
        - More recently, I’m so excited about what Kristina and João bring to
        the product design team. I feel great leaving them in charge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway I just thought like, damn I am good at finding good people! 😂
        But really, y’all please continue to slay it. I’m excited to follow the
        work you do, now as an enthusiastic Grover customer.
      </p>
