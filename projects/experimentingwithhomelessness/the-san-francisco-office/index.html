          Day 35 — Every day is a goddamned adventure. I swear, every day is so
          different. Each weekend I decide what the hell to do with myself, then
          jump head first into whatever dumb, complicated plan I’ve decided on
          for that weekend.
        </p>
        <p>
          This weekend it’s taking a work bus up to the city, and trying to
          sleep in the San Francisco office for the weekend. I’ve slept there
          before. It’s quiet, they have a couch, and security is tight. I’ll be
          fine (wish me luck).
        </p>
        <p>
          Might rent a Zipcar this weekend and drive somewhere. I really need to
          buy a scooter. Or get my car fixed. Scooter’s more fun. It wins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today I got my camping lamps and battery-powered fan in the mail. Nice
          to have light and circulating air that isn’t dependent on my car
          battery. Also managed to clean up a bit. It’s amazing how messy it
          gets when I live without light for too long.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I get a jump, I can’t let my car die again. Too dangerous to be
          trapped like that. I think I’ve been lucky. James said they send out
          notifications when cars are parked in the same spot in the work lots
          for too long. It should be easy to get a jump. Maybe I’ll do that this
          weekend with the Zipcar. What a brilliant idea, right?
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m really enjoying this. I’m falling into a rhythm. Really hoping to
          take this act on the road some time soon. Just gotta throw down on
          those car repairs. That shit kills me.
        </p>
