  <p>It’s a struggle joining a new team, especially when you’re meant to lead it. I documented my ideal first year as a design team lead for my own reference and thought I’d share it for yours.</p><p>Just a note before we get started: there’s not a whole lot of predictability in the first year at a new job. This is meant more as a guideline than a recipe. These are things you should keep in mind along a rough timeline, along with potentially helpful ways to measure your success along the way. Your mileage will definitely vary.</p>
