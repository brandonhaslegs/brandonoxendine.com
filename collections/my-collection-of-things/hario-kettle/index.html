  <p>Sure, this is like the most 💁‍♂️ popular kettle, and everyone has it… but hey maybe some people don’t. Actually I kind of just bought this because I always saw baristas ☕️ using it in good coffee shops. Of course it’s the industry standard (I think?)&nbsp;but also I’m sure there are a lot of other great-looking ones.&nbsp;As with many things I like, this one feels industrial in some way, utilitarian and standard, while also leaving room for some weirdoness (why are the sides bubbly???&nbsp;who cares???).</p><p>By the way, a few years ago when I first bought this kettle, I bought <a href="http://amzn.to/2gyEP7c" target="_blank">the 1 liter version</a>, which somehow is a whole lot smaller than the 1.2 liter version. It’s cute and squat, but it hardly worked for two cups of coffee or tea each morning (and it’s not even cheaper, so why bother?).&nbsp;🙅 Eventually I bought the 1.2 and it’s the perfect size.</p><p>Also worth noting: I want to eventually buy the electrio Hario kettle, to keep my stove free (although I like the way it looks there). Problem is, the electric kettle is even smallerthan the 1 liter! Not tryna make coffee for 🚼 babies!</p><p>🇺🇸 <a href="http://amzn.to/2kEhmGl" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.com</a></p><p>🇩🇪 <a href="http://amzn.to/2g0Nn6d" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.de</a></p>
