        <p>2022 UPDATE:</p>

        <p>
          I found this to get a bit old and stained after a while. It is still
          super sturdy, and it doesn’t get all torn up like cheapo ones, but I
          now use a these cool recycled plastic confetti cutting boards. Got one
          from
          <a
            href="https://fredericksandmae.com/collections/cutting-boards"
            target="_blank"
            >Fredericks and Mae</a
          >
          and another from
          <a
            href="https://www.mykilos.com/shop/accessories/chunk-of-plastic-chopping-board/"
            target="_blank"
            >Mykilos</a
          >. They are SO FUN and basically the same product. Only thing is that
          they could be thicker.

            When you’re cutting, you gotta make sure you’re separating raw meat
            from regular stuff. Also it’s generally smart to buy a non-porous
            cutting board for raw 🐖 meats. Most plastic cutting boards are
            those disgusting, gnarly, thin sheets of plastic that get hacked to
            death and have the (probably useful, but unsightly) moat around the
            edge for juices. This one is a big, heavy plastic cutting board. And
            ain’t a single logo to be found anywhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            I keep this one and the
            <a href="/products/wood-cutting-board">wood block</a> on my counter
            at all times. I use both for various things, but also exclusively
            cut meat on this one. Also, it has feet on it, so no need to attach
            them or worry about it eventually wobbling.
