  <p>I found this to get a bit old and stained after a while. It is still super sturdy, and it doesn’t get all torn up like cheapo ones, but I now use a these cool recycled plastic confetti cutting boards. Got one from <a href="https://fredericksandmae.com/collections/cutting-boards" target="_blank">Fredericks and Mae</a> and another from <a href="https://www.mykilos.com/shop/accessories/chunk-of-plastic-chopping-board/" target="_blank">Mykilos</a>. They are SO FUN and basically the same product. Only thing is that they could be thicker.</p>

<p>When you’re cutting, you gotta make sure you’re separating raw meat from regular stuff. Also it’s generally smart to buy a non-porous cutting board for raw 🐖 meats.&nbsp;Most plastic cutting boards are those disgusting, gnarly, thin sheets of plastic that get hacked to death and have the (probably useful, but unsightly) moat around the edge for juices. This one is a big, heavy plastic cutting board. And ain’t a single logo to be found anywhere.</p><p>I keep this one and the <a href="/products/wood-cutting-board">wood block</a> on my counter at all times. I use both for various things, but also exclusively cut meat on this one. Also, it has feet on it, so no need to attach them or worry about it eventually wobbling.</p><p>🇺🇸&nbsp;<a href="http://amzn.to/2ntiWdi" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.com</a></p><p>🇩🇪&nbsp;<a href="http://amzn.to/2noaoD4" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.de</a></p><p>🇨🇦 <a href="http://amzn.to/2oREame" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.ca</a></p>
