<h2>Bingo Bango</h2>

  <p>A hyperlocal, community-driven delivery service. Bingo Bango goes beyond traditional food delivery by dropping the ability to select items from menus. Open the app, and you can do two things: Get stuff, or make money.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <p>As a requester, you describe your desired item, describe your location, and select a “tip” that you will pay on top of the item’s price. As a moneymaker, you see nearby jobs, assign yourself to them, fetch the desired item from anywhere and deliver it to the requester — in return receiving that aforementioned tip in addition to the price for the item itself.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;
  
    <h1>Make 💸 Money</h1>
  

&nbsp;
  
    <h1>From the community,<br>for the community.</h1>
  

&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <p>Bingo Bango does not care what you want or where you want it. Sitting on a hill in a park and in need of a cool beer? Bingo Bango — someone will go get them for you. In need of some office supplies, but that important meeting is coming up? Bingo Bango — someone will fetch them for you. Really stressed out about your bachelors and no time to commit to meeting a friend? Bingo Bango — someone is probably up for giving you a hug in return for a few bucks.</p><p>It’s like Deliveroo, but for anything. It’s like Amazon Fresh, but faster. It’s like Lieferando, but also for anything and also faster and also the app is good.</p>
