  <p>This one is very near to my heart. I love cocktails, special spirits, nice gins and bourbons, and also entertaining people. Unfortunately most drink carts are very small and not suited for a large collection. I like to display my collection, as well as make it easy to grab martini fixings 🍸 while cooking dinner. So I figured out that the perfect drink cart is actually just a restaurant serving wagon (like for dim sum). I’m really delighted with this one. It’s extremely simple, has bars around the sides to prevent bottles from falling off, and has only two levels (many have three, which just isn’t enough room on the bottom, and is overall a more complex silhouette. My only gripe with this one is that there's a butt-ugly logo on the handles—I hardly notice it though.</p>

  <p>Note: It’s very hard to find this kitchen cart on Amazon.com with the barriers on the sides. <a href="http://amzn.to/2ozklNm" target="_blank">All options</a> I <a href="http://amzn.to/2nAKxt8" target="_blank">found</a> have no barriers, making it impossible to use as a drink cart. If someone finds one, send it to me!</p><p>🇩🇪&nbsp;<a href="http://amzn.to/2o7OkiS" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.de</a></p>
