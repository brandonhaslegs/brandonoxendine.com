              I know I write this a lot, but it’s truly unbelievable how bad the
              market is for well-designed irons. It’s quite similar to the
              vacuum market, lots of ridiculous colors and 〽️ swooshes and bad
              plastics (as opposed to
              <a href="/things/hand-vacuum" target="_blank">good plastics</a>).
              I have luckily found an iron that looks pretty nice.

        <p>A few key things make this iron worth recommending:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              It’s made of this nice plastic that feels very soft to the touch,
              rather than shiny and sticky
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              It only has one color involved in the design (even the two other
              color options 🔴 🔵 are monochromatic)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li><p>The logo is nice, simple, and friendly</p></li>
          <li><p>The cord is fabric-covered</p></li>
        </ul>

          It does suffer from some classic garbage design flaws (For some reason
          “BREEEZE” is printed on the bottom of it 🤷‍♂️) and those stupid icons
          permanently advertising its features even though you already own the
          thing. But I think it’s the least bad one. Note: if you have 250 euro
          to spend on an iron, Morphy Richards has this

          that I kind of love. 🇩🇪
