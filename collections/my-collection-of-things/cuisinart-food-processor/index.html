  <p>This is one of the first things I thought to buy when I first started getting serious about kitchen appliances. 👨‍🍳 It’s right after getting the Kitchen-Aid mixer when you get out of college. This is the appliance that every mom says you need 💁‍♀️ because they all bought one in the 70s or 80s and have been using it since then. It’s a beast of an appliance. It’s very good at what it does. 👌</p><p>I prefer this design because it’s very geometric, symmetrical, and simple. 📐 The aluminum casing matches the rest of my kitchen, and I don’t even really mind the black plastic that much. Compared to the other options on the market, this is definitely the edgiest one (so many are all round and bubbly, blegh).</p><p>🇺🇸 <a href="https://amzn.to/2QHq7yT" target="_blank">Buy it on Amazon.com</a></p><p>🇩🇪 I actually imported mine from the states and plug it into a US to European power converted whenever I use it, but you can <a href="https://amzn.to/2Bsiwdf" target="_blank">buy this uglier version of it on Amazon.de</a></p><p>🇨🇦 <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Cuisinart-DFP-14BCNY-Processor-Brushed-Stainless/dp/B01AXM4WV2/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1545139936&amp;sr=8-4&amp;keywords=cuisinart+food+processor" target="_blank">Buy it on Amazon.ca</a></p>
