          Endless scrolling: the genius move that allows users to simply scroll
          infinitely through content without having to ever press a next button.
          “Genius!” one might say. “Needs work!” I say. Don’t get me wrong, I
          enjoy it as much as the next content-consuming junkie. That is, until
          it breaks; until you scroll for 5,000 pixels and want to see that
          thing you saw a while back up there. Not so fast, there are no pages.
          Have fun scrolling. Remember to write home, tell us how the weather
          is.

          Endless scrolling, with its nice perks, is not without its seriously
          poor usability issues. Here’s another sticky situation you might find
          yourself in: scroll, scroll, scroll, click interesting post, read,
          watch, look … oops, bad move. Click back in your browser, start over
          at the top, cue the “Fuuuuuu-” meme.
        </p>

          Another one if you’re not convinced: I’m not sure what kind of device
          you’re reading this article on, but chances are you don’t have an
          endless amount of processing power. Say you have 100 photos, animated
          GIFs, or videos in your “scroll history.” These kind of assets all
          stacked up on a single page can slow down any upstanding browser, no
          matter the power of the CPU. As I’m not so sure browser crashes are
          good for user experience.

          Tumblr handles this whole problem alright, allowing the user to
          “endless scroll” while converting the position down the page into
          individual pages so that when you do click into a post and then
          proceed to go back in your browser, you go back to
          <em>around</em> where you were last. This sort of takes care of the
          <em>Fuuuuuu- Argument</em>, but I’ve seen it have its glitches. Worthy
          to note: Tumblr is a pretty big operation with great developers always
          making the Tumblr browsing experience the best possible one for their
          users. The problem really exists in Tumblr themes or in blogs with
          less time and money invested in usability. The really bad news is that
          this problem is one that is becoming popular, thus becoming a growing
          issue across the web.

          I’m not saying it’s a bad idea, endless scrolling. It’s actually
          luxurious and an incredibly easy way to look through content. Perhaps
          browser technologies or those really smart developers that make the
          internet work just have to catch up to fixing these issues, but before
          they’re fixed, I can’t really get behind any kid of endless scrolling
          environment.
