        <p>
          Day 71 — Staying with Kelly and James tonight. It was Ryan’s birthday
          today so we partied late and the Caltrain stops running at 12:15 so
          it’s this or the SF office couches. Found out today that James and
          Kelly are breaking up. Feels sad. Might move in with James though
          which is the only good to come of their situation. Very sad. I love
          them. Hope to stay friends with Kelly because she seems like a really
          great person despite what happened between her and James. James is
          also leaving to work at a startup. That’s something he’s wanted to do
          for a while though so good for him. I don’t want to lose him as a
          friend just because we won’t work together anymore. I hope they are
          okay. I started this journey with them, so it’s sad to see them apart.
          They have been together for five years. Reminds me of Erin and I
          except longer and not engaged.
        </p>
        <p>Happy birthday to Ryan though.</p>
