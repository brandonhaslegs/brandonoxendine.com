  <p>When it comes to casual food storage, it really seems like no one cares. Like somehow everyone has the cheapest most plastic, 🕯 meltable containers in their kitchen. I have three sizes: a tiny (sauces, small leftovers), a medium (lunch at work), and a large (big leftovers, baking, casseroles). I prefer the square ones ◽️ ◻️ ⬜️ because they take up more efficient space in the fridge and they hold more volume. These ones also can be used to bake in, 🍞 which is pretty cool. I once cooked the majority of Thanksgiving in these. ✨</p><p>Another great feature of glass food storage: you can fill these things with like say, oily rotting fish, throw them in a bag filled with nice shirts for two days, and the shirts would never know the difference. Ask me how i know.</p><p>Anyway, if you take away anything from this one, do this: buy glass food storage containers. Go, right now into your kitchen, open that cabinet where all the disgusting plastic tubs are, let them fall out on the ground because I know you just shoving them all in there and shutting the door really fast, throw them away, and go buy adult ones. They are so much better.</p><p>🇺🇸 <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/90233788/" target="_blank">Buy on IKEA.com</a></p><p>🇩🇪 <a href="http://www.ikea.com/de/de/catalog/products/90233788/" target="_blank">Buy on IKEA.com/de</a></p>
