  <p>I actually got the Breville Stand Mixer for free, using United MileagePlus points, 💸 but I did pick it out and so I do recommend it. Here are some things I like about it:</p><ul><li><p>The timer function is great. It starts the timer automatically when you start the mixer, so if you have to mix something for a certain amount of time, you don’t have to worry about setting timers or forgetting when you started mixing. It’s even good for small amounts of time, since you just don’t have to think about it.</p></li><li><p>The scraper attachment is cool. It scrapes dough off the bowl as it stirs. It doesn’t always work perfectly, but it’s definitely a nice feature.</p></li><li><p>The electronic dial 🎛 and light-up levels 🎚 are handy if you’re not a pro and don't know the difference between “cream” and “aerate.” I do worry about the machine having the main function controlled by an electronic piece though… don’t electronics always break?</p></li></ul><p>BTW the clear plastic thing around the bowl (not pictured)&nbsp;is stupid, ugly, and flimsy. 🚮 Throw it away.</p>

  <p>I know this isn’t <a href="http://amzn.to/2nF0Ky1" target="_blank">the KitchenAid mixer</a> that everyone agrees is the best, but I really do prefer this one—it feels a bit techy, which is kinda my thing.&nbsp;So despite KitchenAid’s mixer being “the best,”&nbsp;I was always turned off by the vintage look of it. Also KitchenAid’s logo is hella bad—Breville’s is nice IMHO don’t @ me.</p><p>🇺🇸&nbsp;<a href="http://amzn.to/2n3ZSUq" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.com</a></p><p>🇨🇦 <a href="http://amzn.to/2opgeTy" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.ca</a></p>
