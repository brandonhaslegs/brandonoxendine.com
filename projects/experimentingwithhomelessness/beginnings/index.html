          Day 1 — I was hanging out with Kelly and James and Kelly’s Mom and her
          boyfriend, eating pizza. It was getting late so I headed out. At this
          point James and Kelly were under the impression that I moved to the
          city today and was now on my way home for the first time. They were
          partly correct. So when I left their apartment, I drove down to the
          Daly City Target to buy sheets, a blanket, pillows, and pillowcases.
          When I came out from Target with my new goods, I noticed that my front
          left tire was getting dangerously low. I checked the front right one
          and it was in the same place as the left one. So here I am in a Target
          parking lot at 11:00 at night getting ready for my first night
          sleeping in my car, 20 miles from San Francisco, and I need to find a
          gas station with an air pump to pump up my dangerously-close-to-flat
          tires.<br /><br />I Googled the closest gas station, and found that it
          was only just around the block. I drove over carefully, as to not pop
          my tires which in my mind were surely going to pop at any moment, then
          pulled up to the scariest gas station on earth. Luckily it had an air
          pump. I realized that I’d need quarters after pulling up to the pump,
          so I jogged over to the creepy McDonalds next door, bought a
          one-dollar burger and one-dollar small fry, and asked for “three
          dollars in quarters please.”
        </p>
        <p>“Your change is $17, is two dollars in quarters alright?”</p>
        <p>
          “Yeah sure.” I try to be nonconfrontational, and it won’t take too
          long to pump up these tires, so whatever. So I walk back on over next
          door to my car and insert four quarters. The machine revs to life, and
          starts pumping air. These things work right away once you’ve fed them
          your change, so only then did I find that both my front tires were at
          a laughable 22PSI (they’re supposed to be at 43). Anyway, I hold the
          hose to the tire for about a minute, and recheck the PSI. At 30,
          great, this might take a while. I nervously checked the pressure every
          10 seconds or so to see how long this might take, eager to get out of
          this dimly-lit gas station. One more minute later, the pump shuts off.
          I was at a whopping 32PSI. Was that good enough? Gee, I don’t know,
          but I might as well make them even. I shove four more quarters in the
          machine, the tank begins to blow again, and I pull the hose around to
          the right side tire. *SHUNK* Crap, the hose only reaches like five
          feet! I drop it on the ground and hop in the car to pull it around so
          the right tire is closer to the pump. I did the same amount of filling
          up as the other tire, until the pump cut off just after the
          predictable 32PSI MARK. I was too nervous to just think that was
          enough for now, so I embarrassingly trudged back over to the
          McDonalds, ordered a small Diet Coke, was reminded that all sizes were
          just a dollar and “do you want the jumbo size”, politely declined, was
          chastised by the enormous man behind me in line for not getting my
          money’s worth, half-assedly explained my tire situation, took 8 more
          quarters and some change, returned to my sad, sinking car and pumped
          his tires back up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once my car was back to an acceptable and safe-to-drive posture, I was
          finally able to eat my unintentional McDonalds fourthmeal. I took a
          few bites of the burger, ate most of the fries, drank a few sips of
          the Diet Coke before realizing I was about to, hopefully, go to sleep,
          and threw the rest of it out into the overturned trash can in the gas
          station parking lot. I got back in my car, and drove back up to the
          city to find a suitable place to park for the night.
        </p>
        <p>
          As it goes with this kind of adventure, I got a sudden burst of
          optimism and sense of adventure for what I was doing, and decided I
          should go out to a busy part of the city and have a drink with some
          strangers. Must have been the jolt from those precious sips of Diet
          Coke. I ended up on 16th street between Guerrero and Delores. It
          seemed to be a happening place, so I locked the car down, covered up
          my valuables (That should work right?), and headed toward the crowds
          of people. Unfortunately the crowds were crowding around a crime
          scene, rather than some drunk cat fight, or some dude break dancing.
          There were police cars, ambulances showed up, they sectioned off parts
          of the road and sidewalk with caution tape, girls were crying on other
          girls’ shoulders. Witnesses were being interviewed and I caught a
          glimpse of the story, “these guys were just drunk and fighting and one
          guy pulled out a gun and just shot the other guy.” I looked over to
          see a body lying, covered in plastic on the ground, and another guy
          pressed against a police car in handcuffs, pretty calm actually, but
          still very surreal to see. Of course, as fun as all this looked, I was
          eager to get out of the thick of it and decided I would toast with
          strangers another night. I walked back to my car for bed time.<br /><br />Nervous
          about the initial entry into my back seat, I paced around the car a
          while, looking not so unsuspicious. Finally, I popped the back door
          open, and clamored inside, tucking my feet in quickly and slamming the
          door shut behind me. Not too bad. But then I realized you can see out
          of tinted windows from the inside, even if you can’t from the outside.
          And suddenly every person that walked past me could see me in there
          trying to sleep. And soon after that, every person who walked past,
          I’m sure was stopping at my car just to see if they could see in. Even
          these two big mean guys stopped and plotted breaking into my car and
          killing me, I’m sure of it. I barely slept.
