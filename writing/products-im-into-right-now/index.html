          I like writing these. It’s fun and kind of embarrassing to look back
          on the old products I loved. If you want to read previous lists, you
          can read one from 2019

          <h2>🌩 CloudConvert</h2>
          <p>
            Not that sexy of a product, but I use this app multiple times a
            week. So simple and easy to use, it’s FREE. You can convert from any
            file to any file, which sounds like a basic feature but NAME ME ONE
            APP that can do this easily and for free. I’ll wait!
          </p>
          <h2>🌈 Rainbow</h2>
          <p>
            <br />If you’re doing anything with cryptocurrency or decentralized
            stuff and need a wallet, Rainbow is the best one. It’s not even a
            competition really. Best design, easiest to use, and delightful as
            fuck.<br /><br />
          </p>
          <h2>🦉 Duolingo</h2>
          <p>
            <br />I gotta say I don’t think I’ve ever learned a language with
            Duolingo, but I am in love with the app (and addicted to my 500+ day
            streak). I don’t like to waste my time on stupid iPhone games, but I
            do feel the lifeless draw of the glowing rectangle, so I figure why
            not learn a bit of every language while playing a game. Also I still
            hold that Duolingo is a perfectly designed app. There is not a
            single bad thing about their designs. It’s like their designers
            don’t make mistakes. Impeccable product.<br /><br />
          </p>
          <h2>📓 Notion</h2>
          <p>
            <br />They kinda took over the note-taking and life-organizing scene
            over the last few years didn’t they? I’ve introduced a lot of my
            friends to Notion and almost everyone who has tried it came back to
            me in a week and told me about how their entire life is organized in
            Notion now. Such a simple idea, but so well-made. If only their
            mobile apps didn’t suck.<br /><br />
          </p>
          <h2>🏦 Revolut</h2>
          <p>
            <br />I’m on the fence about this one. Their management team is
            apparently a hot mess of a disaster, and sometimes their app feels
            like it never stops spamming you about their features, but what I
            really liked about Revolut from the start is they were the first
            bank to really embrace design as a core part of their service. N26
            did it sure, but N26 has always felt like they’re just a normal bank
            with more clean design. Revolut has features I use all the time, and
            feels like a nice app instead of a boring bank app.<br /><br />
          </p>
          <h2>🛍 Flink</h2>
          <p>
            <br />Since the pandemic a lot has changed in my life, but probably
            the craziest thing is that I never go to grocery stores anymore. I
            order groceries from Flink at least 3 times a week. And I LOVE it.
            It’s so convenient, their selection is fine, and the prices don’t
            have a noticeable price difference. And while I do kinda miss
            running to the Späti for beers at a house party, it’s just way too
            convenient to just order everything directly to you. I also really
            like their fun new feature where you can order a recipe and all the
            ingredients that you need to make it.<br /><br />
          </p>
          <h2>🚮 Aliexpress</h2>
          <p>
            <br />Y’all gonna hate me for this one. I am ADDICTED to Aliexpress.
            I won’t say much about this because the product is literally a
            garbage heap, but damn if they don’t have everything. Also I have a
            few things to say:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Everything you find on Etsy is repackaged from Aliexpress.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Everything you find on Amazon is repackaged from Aliexpress.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Everything comes from China so it’s just like I’m buying
                everything from the source. Don’t @ me, I’m just stating facts!
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

            By the way I just want to note that the products I wrote about last
            time in 2019 are STILL fire. Telegram has never been better. Google
            Photos, while stagnant, is still a solid product. And must I even
            comment on Figma? ❤️
          </p>
          <p>Till next time!</p>
