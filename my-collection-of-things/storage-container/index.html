  <p>This is my favorite kind of product. You know, the kind you find at a hardware store, the kind where the design hasn’t changed since it was first made in 1950 or something, and it’s painted in some very basic bright color. This is in the same style as the blue workbench I have, because they’re both from Bauhaus, a chain of 🛠 hardware stores in Germany. I use it as a storage box for art supplies and various materials, but also as a coffee table in the studio—it has a 100x55cm footprint.</p><p>Note: It’s huge, so once full it becomes hard to move.&nbsp;I put mine on a piece of wood with casters so it’s very easy to move.</p><p>🇩🇪&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bauhaus.info/werkzeugkoffer-werkzeugboxen/stahlblechtragekiste-/p/11141700" target="_blank">Buy on Bauhaus.info</a></p><p>🇩🇪&nbsp;<a href="http://amzn.to/2nofsqd" target="_blank">Buy a dark green version on Amazon.de</a></p>
