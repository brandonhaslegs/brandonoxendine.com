          Yeah I do things other than design. I just wanted to put this out
          there. There is endless bullshit online about losing weight, but it’s
          all garbage and not much is really helpful. These are things I’ve
          learned that have worked for me.

          <h3>
            🧮 First, the only thing that matters: You cannot lose weight
            without tracking your calories. If you don’t do that, it’s not gonna
            work. Sorry.
          </h3>
          <h3>
            Also exercise doesn’t do anything to help you lose weight. I mean it
            does but it’s such a tiny amount of calories you can literally eat a
            donut after a workout and it’ll have been for nothing.

          <h3>🧬 Eat “high protein” everything</h3>
          <p>
            I buy high protein pudding, cheese, chips, all kinds of snacks. Of
            course if you want to gain muscle, you can get protein powder. Just
            mix powder with water, it’s easy and it tastes better than it
            sounds. But also something people don’t talk about much: protein
            keeps you full, which is what it’s all about!

          <h3>🥒 Always have pickles.</h3>
          <p>
            I feel like a big hack to losing weight is finding ways to pack
            flavor into zero calories. Spices and salt are key. Pickles have SO
            MUCH flavor and basically no calories. You’re allowed to eat them
            all the time, they are delicious, crunchy, full of flavor, and come
            in many varieties.

          <h3>🥕 Always have carrots.</h3>
          <p>
            I guess this might be a bit of a lame tip. They aren’t that
            appetizing, and a bit boring, but have no calories and lots of
            crunch. It’s a pretty good combination. I always keep bags of baby
            carrots in the fridge. It’s worked well for me sometimes, but
            obviously sometimes they get really boring.

          <h3>🥤 Low calorie drinks.</h3>
          <p>
            You gotta find a low calorie drink you can drink all the time, all
            day long. Mine is La Croix, but I’ve also tried Liquid Death (tbh
            way too expensive) and sugar/caffeine free sodas. The sodas gave me
            headaches, I think there’s too much chemistry going on in them.

          <h3>🍛 Sad Frozen Meals.</h3>
          <p>
            Making this whole journey easy and fast will always help. I don’t
            see this as a long term solution because it’s ridiculously dumb for
            the environment and not that tasty, but for a 6-12 month weight loss
            period, I think it’s fine. Live like someone who doesn’t believe in
            climate change for a bit. I only buy meals or prepared salads with
            around 500 calories. These totally help prevent overeating since you
            only have a confined amount of food. And listen…I love to cook. This
            is a painful tip to give, but it does work. Usually when I cook, I
            cook too much, or it’s hard to track every thing I cook with
            accurately. This can be an easy way to eat something low calorie,
            fast, and easy. Sorry.

          <h3>🥪 Chicken Deli Slices.</h3>
          <p>
            This was one of the big weird breakthroughs I had. I buy a ton of
            packages of turkey or chicken deli slices. You can just chop it up
            and put it into salads or even snack on it. It’s high protein, which
            makes it filling, but in my opinion most importantly it’s
            pre-seasoned and portioned making it more convenient to consume than
            chicken breasts. Again, I don’t think this is a long term solution
            due to the packaging waste. But for a while, sure.

          <h3>👠 Eat “like a model” until 2pm.</h3>
          <p>
            This sounds crazy, but it’s basically fasting which has been shown
            not only to help people lose weight, but also to be really healthy!
            So I am absolutely someone who wakes up and could eat a massive
            breakfast every single day. I used to think it was necessary for me
            to eat a full meal every morning. Until one morning, where I ate a
            single baby carrot after waking up. I ate it, waited 10 minutes, and
            my hunger subsided. And trust me I’m ferociously hungry in the
            mornings, but it worked! Doing this (or just fasting) until 2pm has
            been pretty easy for me. Sometimes after 2pm I go nuts and eat like
            a 1200 calorie cheeseburger or nachos but you know what? If I
            haven’t eaten yet and it’s that late in the day, I can. And that
            feels good sometimes.

            So that’s it. And remember: Ain’t a damn thing wrong with being fat,
            PERIODT. These are just things that have worked for me when I’ve
            felt like losing weight.
