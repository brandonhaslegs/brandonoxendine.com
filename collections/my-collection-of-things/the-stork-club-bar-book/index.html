            I claim this is the best book for cocktails, hands down. It is so
            quaint, informative, short, and funny. I regularly pull it out to
            random pages to make a new 🍹 cocktail. Also the cover was designed
            by Paul Rand, so yeah. The book is organized by times of day, which
            makes for exceptionally hilarious situations where you find the
            author recommending you start off the day with a 🍸 martini for
            breakfast—hey it was written in 1946, that was normal back then
            (???).

              >the more expensive hardcover</a
            >, someone redesigned it and it’s laughably bad. While I’d love to
            have a hardcover version of this, that's the wrong one to buy,
            friend.
