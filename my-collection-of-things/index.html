      <p>Doesn’t everyone have at least one bluetooth speaker in their lives at this point? I’ve been on my bluetooth speaker game since 2011 when I got the first Jambox. And here’s the thing: Bluetooth is the worst technology ever invented. Seriously it’s horrible, but it’s also convenient when it works, so hey whatever.</p>

      <h2><a href="/my-collection-of-things/9oz-candlefish-library-candles/">Candlefish Library Candles</a></h2>
      <p>I love these candles. Admittedly, it’s better to go into the Candlefish store in Charleston, South Carolina if you can and sniff like a million candles (ok there are only 100 scents in their library… but 100!!), but also they’re all generally great-smelling candles, so just go with your gut and choose a scent that sounds good. Since they’re Candlefish’s own collection, I think they try to keep the cost as low as possible. I think 22 bucks for a nice, relatively large, candle is pretty good. Also the design of the label isn’t dumb, it has gold ink 🤤&nbsp;an embossed gold logo (designed by Fuzzco, where I used to work), and the volume checkbox is hand-ticked, which is a nice touch.</p>

      <p>Ok I still don’t know which ones to recommend 😣&nbsp;(sorry). But I’ll settle on these. I really like them because they are very simple. They’re the simplest measuring cups I have (In a quest to find the best ones, I ended up with three sets). Unfortunately it’s a bit difficult to read the volume measurements on the inside, but if you’re a little clever, you can memorize which one is which volume.</p>

      <p>I know there are a multitude of various good glassware 🍹 🍸 🍷 🥃 🥂 you can find, but I found these nice and simple. I fell in love with this style of cocktail glass (a coupe)&nbsp;when I started going to cocktail bars in San Francisco. They are nice and compact, less prone to splashing 💦&nbsp;than martini glasses, and make any drink feel like a little 💎 precious thing. Turns out they’re just old-style champagne glasses. I’m sometimes tempted by vintage glassware, and I might try to find some at some point, but for now these are a great,&nbsp;simple styled coupe glass. I like to pour any drink served “up” into these.</p>

      <p>I first saw this wallet when one of my friends pulled it out years ago and it’s been on my wishlist since. I thought it was so great that it’s so compact, still fits in my pocket but makes room for lots of storage. 🗄️ Finally I got it for my birthday. 🎁 What I really love about this one is that has a super low profile from the outside, but the inside is bright blue. 🖤💙 Also nice that it zips completely closed, so you can just stuff stuff inside of it and zip it closed and it won’t fall out. It’s exactly the size of a passport too 🛂 so even though it’s not meant for it, you can just barely fit a passport inside of it and zip it closed.</p>

      <p>TBQH why not have a little fun with cocktail picks? (Just a little, we’re not trashy are we)&nbsp;I like these swords. 🤺 They are swords. They are actually quite heavy, don’t feel cheap, and the picker is thick. Overall it feels fun while also feeling like a quality addition to a Martini or Manhattan.</p>

      <p>Ok I don’t know if designer toothpaste is too much for you but stick with me, okay? Like I have said, things do not need to look bad in your life. You deserve the best. There are approximately 836150729 brands of toothpaste, and they all basically look like this: ✨🌟💫 (like in a bad way?).&nbsp;But there doesn’t need to be an eyesore that you have to use and look at every day in your bathroom!&nbsp;So get you some good looking toothpaste. Also I would never recommend toothpaste that didn’t taste and feel right, so that’s a given—it’s fresh.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>This is one of the first things I thought to buy when I first started getting serious about kitchen appliances. 👨‍🍳 It’s right after getting the Kitchen-Aid mixer when you get out of college. This is the appliance that every mom says you need 💁‍♀️ because they all bought one in the 70s or 80s and have been using it since then. It’s a beast of an appliance. It’s very good at what it does. 👌</p>

      <p>I LOVE THIS VACUUM. It’s very “shiny plastic spaceship”&nbsp;🚀&nbsp;and since it stays stored in the bathroom and only comes out when I use it, I don’t mind that. But also it’s kinda pretty… it’s Dyson after all. It also legit sounds like an airplane when you turn it on—it is so powerful. Yes it’s pricy, but friggin who cares it’s a spaceship.</p>

      <p>This is the tool I do all my pencil illustrations with. 👨🏻‍🎨 The lead is super thick, so there’s a lot of flexibility in line weight depending on how much you sharpen it or wear it down. ✍️ I also love the mechanism for how the lead is held in the pencil. It’s a standard clutch pencil but I just really love the thickness of this one. It’s really squat and wide, so it feels nice to hold and use.</p>

      <p>Honestly I just wanted one of these. I haven’t used it yet, but it’s definitely the best one I’ve found. I assume around 🎄 Christmas Cookie Season 🍪 I'll give it a good amount of use. It can also be used to generally scrape up your workstation and keep things clean.</p>

      <p>I have a Google Home House. 🤓 In my tiny apartment, I’ve insisted that we have three Google Home Minis and one Google Home Hub. One in each room, that’s how it’s supposed to work, right? 💁‍♂️ These little devices, while obviously not the best sound quality, are just so cute and so useful to have around the house. I of course made sure to buy one in each color. The coral one is in the living room (stylish), the charcoal one is in the kitchen (utilitarian, matches the kitchen appliances), and the grey one in the bedroom (the last color left).</p>

      <p>This is a nice little device to have if you’re a Google Home house. It doesn’t have a camera (the new one does) which is the only weird thing about it. Otherwise the materials and color are really nice, the sound 📻 is pretty good, and the display is great for the price. Another cool thing about the display is that it has pretty amazing auto-dimming functionality that makes the screen always match the ambient light 💡 of the room. So in the dark of the night, the screen is barely on. I have the screensaver set to show pictures of my cats (Google Photos automatically finds these and adds them to a cats album, so it’s always current 😻).</p>

      <p>There are lots of choices for a pour over coffee dripper. I like to keep my coffee-making stuff in the family, so I went with with Hario for my dripper. And WHO KNEW they had a metal 🏗 version.

      <p>Sure, this is like the most 💁‍♂️ popular kettle, and everyone has it… but hey maybe some people don’t. Actually I kind of just bought this because I always saw baristas ☕️ using it in good coffee shops. Of course it’s the industry standard (I think?)&nbsp;but also I’m sure there are a lot of other great-looking ones.&nbsp;As with many things I like, this one feels industrial in some way, utilitarian and standard, while also leaving room for some weirdoness (why are the sides bubbly???&nbsp;who cares???).</p>

      <p>When it comes to casual food storage, it really seems like no one cares. Like somehow everyone has the cheapest most plastic, 🕯 meltable containers in their kitchen. I have three sizes: a tiny (sauces, small leftovers),&nbsp;a medium (lunch at work), and a large (big leftovers, baking, casseroles). I prefer the square ones ◽️ ◻️ ⬜️ because they take up more efficient space in the fridge and they hold more volume. These ones also can be used to bake in, 🍞 which is pretty cool. I once cooked the majority of Thanksgiving in these. ✨</p>

      <p>Baking mats are great because you never have to grease a baking sheet literally ever. There’s a really popular brand (Silpat) that honestly I think looks a little too Home Depot for me, so I went looking for a better looking alternative. I found Kitzini, which has a nice logo typeset in Futura, and comes with two nice versions of red and blue. So besides these being IMO integral to baking (please don't buy parchment paper, what a waste 🙄) I also think they are very nice looking.</p>

      <p>These baking pans are the ones that most sites recommend. 🍪 I like them because they have a cool logo etched into the metal (etched viking head) and they’re quite sturdy while remaining light (heavy baking pans can be annoying to handle). I have dented one of them, so they’re not like indestructible like some I’ve seen, but I think since they’re aluminum (best for baking), that’s bound to happen. They have high walls around the edge which is practical for avoiding slosh 🌊&nbsp;but also makes it look more industrial which I like.</p>

The utility of the interior-measurement 📏 labels is unparalleled.

      <p>This one is very near to my heart. I love cocktails, special spirits, nice gins and bourbons, and also entertaining people. Unfortunately most drink carts are very small and not suited for a large collection. I like to display my collection, as well as make it easy to grab martini fixings 🍸 while cooking dinner. So I figured out that the perfect drink cart is actually just a restaurant serving wagon (like for dim sum). I’m really delighted with this one. It’s extremely simple, has bars around the sides to prevent bottles from falling off, and has only two levels (many have three, which just isn’t enough room on the bottom, and is overall a more complex silhouette. My only gripe with this one is that there's a butt-ugly logo on the handles—I hardly notice it though.</p>

Most dish scrubbers that I have bought end up being a gross wrangled mess of bristles. The whole brush head is just flat after a month of use. This one however,&nbsp;I’ve owned for almost six months, and the bristles haven’t bent at all. It’s a larger-than-usual dish scrubber that feels very sturdy. I bought a replacement brush head that I’m not sure I’ll ever actually use because these bristles are so strong.</p>

      <p>I’ve struggled with trash cans in my life.&nbsp;😐 I don’t think I ever had a good one until this year when I got this one. But this one is great! At first I sort of didn’t like the big foot pedal, but now I actually think it looks kind of industrial crank-turn-ish. Also everything about this is super solid and I’m pretty sure it will never break. I avoided simplehuman for a long time because 1) they’re friggin expensive and 2) it just felt extremely bland? Kind of like OXO? But this one has proved to be very good and I think it looks quite nice. Also it has this feature where you can rest the inner container on a little lip inside while you change the bag out 👌 which is actually very very helpful.</p>

      <h2><a href="/my-collection-of-things/storage-container/">Storage Container</a></h2>
      <p>This is my favorite kind of product. You know, the kind you find at a hardware store, the kind where the design hasn’t changed since it was first made in 1950 or something, and it’s painted in some very basic bright color. This is in the same style as the blue workbench I have, because they’re both from Bauhaus, a chain of 🛠 hardware stores in Germany. I use it as a storage box for art supplies and various materials, but also as a coffee table in the studio—it has a 100x55cm footprint.</p>

      <p>Basically I buy books that look good 📖 that I hope also have great content. There is mostly a correlation, I’ve found. But I mean really we all get our recipes from the internet 💻 so recipe books are just nice to have around the house, and they might as well look good.</p>

      <p>Ok, most kitchen shears are pretty simple and not bad-looking. Black handles, thick profile—normal stuff. But THESE, first,&nbsp;are Japanese 🎎 which makes them much better than another thing made out of steel that cuts. They also are totally stainless steel ⚒&nbsp;and made from just two pieces. They also separate quick and easy for cleaning which is super convenient after cutting down something gnarly like a chicken. And of course, they look great!</p>

      <p>Litter scoopers are disgusting. 🤮 And usually they’re this really flimsy plastic. This is a thing you use almost every day that should do a really good job every time. Why not buy a good metal one? I love the size of this thing. It’s pretty big, and really solid. Easy to clean and looks good as new after it’s clean. ✨</p>

      <p>I love blendy things. 🌀 I always knew I needed the Cuisinart food processor in my kitchen. Learned that from every mom ever. But what I never really knew I NEEDED in my kitchen was a simple immersion blender. These things are a fraction of the price of a food processor or a blender, and they’re super versatile. I use mine almost every day to make purées. It’s nice to use an immersion blender because you just stick it in whatever pot, pan, or bowl your food is in. With blenders and food processors you got a whole army of parts to wash afterwards.</p>

      <p>This thing is very large. I really like it because it’s super duper thick and also has a nice logo in metal set on the front (hey I like a logo if it’s not God-awful and especially if it’s cast out of friggin ⚔️ metal).</p>

      <h2><a href="/my-collection-of-things/portable-charger/">Zendure A5 Portable Charger</a></h2>
      <p>Alright, so I’m kind of obsessed with having portable batteries with me. I carry this one in a black string backpack with me everywhere. I have offered a charging cord to so many people in a club at 4 in the morning—it’s very handy. I highly recommend my always-charged 🔋 lifestyle. It’s also nice to always be able to leave the house without worrying if my phone is charged. This thing holds about 4 or 5 full phone charges, so I have rarely been in a situation where it doesn’t last long enough for one outing (or trip through multiple airports, a 3-day festival, a picnic). Also it looks like a Rimowa suitcase so yeah…</p>
