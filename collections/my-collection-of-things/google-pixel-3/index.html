        <p>2021 UPDATE:</p>
        <p>
          I mainly use an iPhone 12 Mini now, and iOS is really nice in a lot of
          ways. That said, I still carry around my Pixel 3 sometimes because I
          consistently get much better photos with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also a lot of the gripes I had about the Android UI have been resolved
          in the last few years. Google’s UI language is really solid and
          honestly super good now.
        </p>
        <p>2020 UPDATE:</p>
        <p>
          I wrote this post in 2018 about the Pixel 2, but now am using the
          Pixel 3. The Pixel is still the best Android phone you can buy. Three
          things are worth noting that I particularly like about the Pixel 3:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              They brought wireless charging to the Pixel. I never expected when
              I got my Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S that I would really love wireless
              charging as much as I do, but it’s just so convenient to never
              have to plug in your phone. An added bonus of never plugging in
              your phone is that you never get the myriad of little charging
              cord scratches on the bottom of the phone where you attempted to
              plug in a million times. It also looks really cool to just set a
              phone on a pad and see it charge. 🤤
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The new wide-angle selfie cam is SO COOL. 🙌 It’s like one of the
              most useful new features I didn’t know I’ve needed on a phone in
              the last few years. It’s so cool to show off, and it gives you the
              opportunity to get a more wide angle lens look if you’re looking
              for that in a selfie. I’ve done the “Well you should just get a
              Pixel 3 if you want to get everyone into the picture” often
              enough. Sorry…
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The new hardware feels much more premium on the Pixel 3. Somehow
              the decisions they made just feel better and less plastic
              Android-y.
            </p>

        <p>2018 REVIEW OF THE PIXEL 2:</p>
        <p>
          It’s really hard to switch phones. Everything is new and different;
          patterns, features, organization—everything needs to be relearned.
          When I switched from my iPhone 7 Plus to a Google Pixel 2 I was pretty
          disappointed<a
            href="https://twitter.com/brandonhaslegs/status/926369208413417472"
            target="_blank"
            >¹</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was extremely excited for this phone. A few other people I knew had
          already switched, I’d seen the reviews on every site, seen the
          beautiful photos from the camera, browsed the new Google store<a
            href="https://store.google.com"
            target="_blank"
            >²</a
          >. I was convinced. Everyone said “Yes, the Pixel 1 was good, but this
          is The iPhone Killer.” Then I read Josh Topolsky’s review<a
            href="https://theoutline.com/post/2403/a-review-of-the-pixel-2-xl-from-someone-who-would-never-lie-to-you?zd=1"
            target="_blank"
            >³</a
          >
          of it and basically I was sold.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the designers on my team at work is a big Google fan—he’s never
          really been into Apple, uses a Surface as his personal computer, and
          has had a Pixel since before it was cool. So when I received my
          package from Grover<a href="https://grover.com/de-en" target="_blank"
            >⁴</a
          >
          (yes, I rented it—I won’t commit to anything) we both stared in giddy
          anticipation as I, a lifelong Apple user, 📦 unboxed and set up my new
          Google Pixel 2. 🤗
        </p>
        <p>
          But my excitement stopped there. It’s just a phone, I thought. 😐 It’s
          just an <em>Android</em> phone. The UI typeface is still Roboto. Sure
          the transitions are smoother now but it still has this weird, crusty,
          grey feel of Android. Dialog boxes and modals are still that Androidy
          square, animations sometimes clunky—apps often feel like strange
          mobile website afterthoughts. And it’s not just Android, the
          industrial design is disappointing too. The XL looks better, but the
          normal black Pixel 2 really just looks like any phone. It’s not sexy,
          it doesn’t seem special. 🤷‍♂️ The website makes the phone look extremely
          nice, but in real life, it looks basic.

          <h1>The Bad</h1>
          <p><br />To get into the details, here’s a listacle 📝 of gripes:</p>

          <p>
            Unlocking your phone when it’s laying on a table is annoying. Moving
            from an iPhone 7 with TouchID to this is really annoying. Although I
            guess the other alternative (iPhone X) requires you to pick up 🤳
            your phone to unlock it too. This is dumb.
          </p>
          <p>
            <del
              >The screen turns greyscale when you switch it off instead of just
              fading to black. It’s ugly.</del
            >
            The new Android P Beta did away with this.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving from an OS that used 📳 vibrations and haptic feedback really
            well to one that kinda just vibrates whenever you touch it feels
            cheap.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like on iOS, keyboard shortcuts<a

            work? 😡

            Eventually, the keyboard did learn my email address.

            Font rendering is horrible. Check out these two screenshots, first
            is Apple, second is Google. Pay close attention to how the letters
            bounce up and down in the right screenshot. WTF is even going on
            here?

            The screen is bad. It has some kind of weird auto sharpening on it
            where when you look at a dark shape on a white background (AKA text
            everywhere), there’s a white drop shadow under it. I guess it’s just
            a cheap screen? But remember this is the normal Pixel 2 not the XL
            that supposedly has a bad screen.

          <h1>The Good</h1>
          <p>
            <br />Listen though, after all that, I really have to say… Android
            is good. The details may not be completely there, which is
            superficial really, but Android is smart in ways that Apple hasn’t
            managed to figure out at all. Of course this lies in the fact that
            Apple is a hardware company and Google is a software company. Apple
            has always sucked at The Internet, and Google… well Google
            <em>is</em> The Internet. Anyway, here are some things I’ve really
            enjoyed:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The Google Assistant</strong> is really, really good. I mean
            I probably don’t have to explain to you the cringeworthy thing that
            is Siri. And generally I always distrusted voice assistants,
            probably because of my experience with Siri, and then later with
            Amazon Alexa. Sorry to the h8rs, they both suck. The Google
            Assistant is just really good. It does things you think it will do
            (amazing!). You can type to it instead of always having to speak
            (revolutionary!). It’s very smart. If you have the Google Home
            system, it’s even better and smarter. The feature that automatically
            recognizes the song playing around you and displays it on your lock
            screen. 😭👌 So good.

            <strong>The settings app</strong> is really well organized, and
            compared to iOS, it’s so much more useful. Just look at these
            screens. They are beautiful and exactly what I want in a settings
            app.

            I’ve really grown to love the
            <strong>notifications tray (plus control panel)</strong>. It’s
            smart, flexible, extendable, apps can do cool stuff in it. It’s a
            place where the open Android system really shines.

            And probably the only thing you’ve ever heard about the Google
            Pixel. <strong>The camera</strong> is amazing. And honestly the real
            reason I’m bound to staying with Google phones forever:
            <strong
              ><em
                >when you buy a Google Pixel, you get endless free high
                resolution storage on Google Photos forever</em
              ></strong
            >. 😲 I’ll end on these photos because they’re nice to look at. Go
            ahead, click on them and see them in all their glory.

            The front-facing camera has portrait mode too. 🤓 If you expand
            them, you’ll see there’s sometimes clipping issues in the background
            blurring.

            Even normal photos somehow look great. I took this first photo out
            of frustration while waiting for a flight. The second one I took
            while waiting for food at a restaurant. Low light plus portrait mode
            (plus moving fish!).

            So where does that leave me today? Staring at an iPhone X pretty
            sure I can’t switch back. I’m excited to see the Pixel 3. And hey
            maybe Apple will make a truly “all screen” phone, who knows… you
            know y’all killin me with that notch (the real reason we even talkin
            about Android). 😂
