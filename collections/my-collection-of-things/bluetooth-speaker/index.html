        <p>
          Doesn’t everyone have at least one bluetooth speaker in their lives at
          this point? I’ve been on my bluetooth speaker game since 2011 when I
          got the first Jambox. And here’s the thing: Bluetooth is the worst
          technology ever invented. Seriously it’s horrible, but it’s also
          convenient when it works, so hey whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the last two years, I’ve been really blown away from Bang &amp;
          Olufsen’s line of Bluetooth speakers. The sound is unparalleled with
          other bluetooth speakers, they’re designed to actually look good
          instead of like sports uniforms, or like “Hell 🎧 yeah DJ ⚡️ lyfe
          let’s get faded” aesthetic. They’re made from metal, leather, rubber,
          and they’re generally just super great products that feel
          intentionally designed. They also look really good sitting around the
          house, unlike many that look like nerf gun garbage.

          I have the B&amp;O Play A1 (pictured) and the Beolit 15. It’s worth
          mentioning that the
          <a href="http://amzn.to/2nZIvE9" target="_blank">Beolit 15</a> is
          incredibly powerful, and quite big for a bluetooth speaker. Also worth
          mentioning that I use these devices mainly plugged in at home (or
          plugged into a wireless power supply) and when I’ve tried using them
          at a picnic without
          <a href="/products/portable-charger" target="_blank">external power</a
          >, they’ve died in about 2 hours of reasonable use. Yes, this is
          pathetic, but I carry external power with me literally everywhere, so
          it’s really not a huge pain point for me.

          Tip: I keep a bluetooth speaker in my 🛀 bathroom. Just switch it on,
          and you’ve got music playing while you shower, put on makeup, or take
          a dookie. I got this tip from my friend,
          <a href="http://benjack.com" target="_blank">Ben Jack</a>, the king of
          convenience.

        <p>2021 UPDATE:</p>
        <p>
          I have various Google Home speakers all over my apartment now. While
          they sometimes suck, they’re cheap and pretty convenient to play music
          all over the apartment really quickly.
