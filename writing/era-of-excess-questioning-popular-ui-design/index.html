          I recently read an

          that I thought would satisfy my hunger for an intelligent critique on
          popular UI design, but it was mostly about scumorphic design failing
          in certain situations; an interesting article, I recommend it, but it
          wasn’t what I was looking for. So, here, dear readers, I present you
          with a good old fashioned critique on that kind of design so many web
          weirdos love. Complete with drop shadows, 3D buttons, glass shines,
          gradients, and outer glows. It’s the latest thing, if you didn’t know.
          If you’ve used a computer within the last 10 years, you’ve seen some
          variation of it. Whether it’s Apple’s “Aqua” UI that has been in place
          since the late 90s, or the latest social media site, this era is upon
          us.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems obvious to me that these trends are unnecessary, but so much
          in life is unnecessary. Although it’s important, it’s hard to justify
          necessity as a meaningful critique of design. It’s just so confusing
          as to why it is the industry standard, why it looks so nice in some
          cases, and why it is widely accepted as part of an overall positive
          user experience.
        </p>
        <h2>Technological Advances</h2>
        <p>
          <br />This sort of design came to be partly because of the tools that
          were put in front of designers. Photoshop offered these fun effects to
          play with, and designers couldn’t resist. The web was our playground.
          The internet is the most advanced space a designer can work in so I
          guess it’s only natural to want to <em>make the interface cooler</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wouldn’t necessarily say that humanity was begging for these sort of
          interfaces—they weren’t, trust me. It’s to a certain degree the design
          program’s influence on designers that makes this sort of thing rear
          its mostly ugly head. It’s really the designers who wield these tools
          in a way that feels so “real” that confuses me. Hyper realistic icons
          and interfaces confuse me. Apple, while not stylistically in line with
          my ideas of design, does a good many things very well. So when I see
          an icon, something that should convey meaning in a very compact space,
          that is essentially a shiny photo-realistic beautifully-rendered
          object, I become confused. When I see an application made to take
          notes that looks like a yellow notepad complete with ripped out pages,
          and stitching around the edge to simulate a leather binding, I am
          confused. These things are <em>so cool</em>, and I could never make
          them, therefore they are good, right? It has become an industry
          standard when making an application to make the icon shine shinier and
          feel slicker than all of its neighbors, but this does little for users
          but make the application look slicker and shinier, which is good
          because—well, I don’t really think it does any good at all.

          from Michael Beirut, I learned a lot about the way Massimo Vignelli
          looks at design. Not that I didn’t know a lot about him already, but
          it was an insight into working for him that piqued my interest. So
          what would he do? He’s a minimalist. “Why would you use Franklin
          Gothic when you can use Helvetica” he’d say. If you’re not on the
          Vignelli Bandwagon, consider our friendly famed designer Paul Rand.
          WWRD? These are our design heroes. Yes, things were different “back in
          their day,” but it’s not like their work is irrelevant by any means
          today. It absolutely stands the test of time, that’s why it’s so
          valuable. That’s why we idolize it, and teach students to idolize it.
          So in this world of slick and shine, let us think of our design
          heroes. Perhaps we should think not in drop shadows and glass effects,
          but in simplicity. Perhaps we make only what we need, and not bog down
          design with useless tidbits.

          produces is thick with Apple goo. Their interfaces are slick, rounded,
          and filled to the top with gradients. And they’re nice. They’re well
          thought out and executed perfectly. This is where I get confused
          again. This is where I find it hard to decide whether any of this
          matters, whether I’m right in thinking all of this kind of design is
          pollution or not. Take a look at iPhone and iPad apps Apple has
          developed. Take a look at the Apple website. It truly is all around us
          and it’s thriving.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ll admit that I don’t get it. I’ll assume that the general populace
          benefits from this hyper realistic design and finds interfaces easier
          to use when they can relate them to the real world. The real world has
          shadows, subtle textures, shininess, smooth shifts from color to
          color. But as a designer who thinks about the web all day, every day,
          I really don’t want to stand for it. I could never see myself coming
          to the conclusion that adding an inordinate amount of
          <em>fake realism</em> to my designs would make them more relatable.
          I’d assume those sorts of things distract and confuse people. They
          ubiquitize design, they don’t solve individual problems. There’s no
          way that a single, particular aesthetic can be successfully applied to
          all design problems and <em>work</em>, right? Metalab seems to think
          so. So does Apple. Take it as you might, people seem to love the guff.
