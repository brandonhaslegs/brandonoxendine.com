  <pre><code>2021 UPDATE:</code></pre><p>For my birthday this year my friends all pitched in to buy me a really nice Japanese chef knife which I love. I still use this knife though because it’s o comfortable to hold and has such a nice size.</p>

<p>I’m constantly searching for good 🔪 knives that aren’t ugly. Currently I have Slitbar knives from IKEA. I know, whatever, but they’re alright and don’t look terrible. They’re no longer available from IKEA, which is a shame because I think they were the least-bad option there.</p><p>But! I also have two all stainless steel MUJI knives (Now we’re friggin talkin) which I really love because 1) they are all stainless steel, 2) MUJI always makes super simple and quality products, and 3) they have nothing to gripe about design-wise. Also if you’re looking for more than a chef’s knife and a paring knife, you’re doing something wrong, friend. I use a chef’s knife 95% of the time.</p><p>🇺🇸 <a href="https://amzn.to/2QLXZHc" target="_blank">Buy it on Amazon.com</a></p><p>PS: I’m always searching for a nice, beautiful, likely very expensive Japanese knife (you know the type). If anyone has a recommendation for a simple, beautiful one available on Amazon that they like, let me know! Ideally it would have some tite Japanese ㊙️ inscribed on the sides and a really sexy damascus pattern on it.</p>
