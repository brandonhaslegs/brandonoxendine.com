        <p>
          When onboarding designers to a new team, making them feel welcome and
          fully prepared to do their job can dramatically improve their
          performance and feeling about their new job. I’ve seen designers start
          on new teams, never get a good onboarding, and later get in trouble
          for not being a team player. 🤦🏼‍♂️
        </p>
        <p>
          So let’s prevent that from happening. If you’re a design manager, read
          through this and think about using it as a jumping off point for your
          team. Of course you’ll have to change plenty of it to fit your
          workplace, but try it out, your team will thank you!

          <p>
            Most of this will be taken care of by HR, but it’s nice to confirm
            they got their accounts set up and ensure they’re logged in
            everywhere they need to be.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Confirm they’ve been added to the Figma team.</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If you use Jira, Asana, GitHub, or any other issue tracking
                software, add them to the team.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Add to all design team Slack or Discord channels and let the
                team know they’re online.

          <p>🙇‍♀️ Heads up</p>
          <p>
            Just a few things they should know about or do on their first day.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Tell them they should email the team and include their role,
                where they’re from, something they like to do outside of work,
                and if you have an office, how long they’ve lived in the city.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If you have a weekly all-hands, get them ready to introduce
                themselves in front of the whole company, just so it’s not
                unexpected.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If you have any special employee discounts, explain these to
                them and encourage them to make use of them.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Encourage them to add a real photo to Slack (so people can
                recognize them around the office).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Add their job description to Slack (so people know what they
                do).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Encourage them to change their name on Slack to their first name
                so it’s more natural when they’re mentioned in messages.
              </p>

          <p>
            Give out special designer swag to designers—they love this shit. Try
            to find things with a more refined taste than the standard
            onboarding t-shirt and sticker. Heck, maybe just make all your swag
            better and don't only give cool stuff to designers!

            something in a pinch, you empower them to do that.

            Explain how you work in your design software. How do you mark things

                ⭐️ The star in front of a file name signifies that a file is a
                canonical file — the file you need to pay attention to. The
                purpose of this is to make clear when you’re looking through all
                the random files we’ve made over the years and see the files
                that matter. Ideally we could get rid of this symbol.

            If you don’t have a dedicated illustrator, it may happen that
            product designers create an illustration or two. Instead of dreading
            this, set them up for at least coloring within the lines.

          <p>ℹ️ Icons</p>
          <p>
            Designers will certainly be making icons, but it’s important to box
            them in a bit so there aren’t duplicates, and so that you’re using
            existing assets linked from your design system.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Show them the icon component file.</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Explain they need to always import an icon as a component, and
                never draw an icon directly into a file.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>All icons should be linked.</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If you make a new icon, make sure to put it in the icon
                component file.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Never use anything in a design that’s not a component. If you
                want to add a component, ask the team if something like it
                exists, and if it doesn’t, make a new component!

            <li><p>Explain how to make a component.</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Explain how type styles work and that any text in any design
                should always be linked to a type style.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Similarly, show how color styles work and make sure it's clear
                that no random hex codes should be showing up in designs.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If you have more complex components like navigation and forms,
                show them those too. Explain that they should try to never
                detach a component and change it in a design file.

            If you used this to onboard a designer, I’d love to hear about it.
            Would also love to hear if you think this is a load of B.S. Anyway
