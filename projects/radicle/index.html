      <h1>Radicle</h1>

      <p>
        A way to collaborate on code built on a p2p protocol instead of hosted
        on centralized servers. In the decentralized crypto future, everyone
        will use Radicle.

        <h1>The Brand</h1>

        <p>
          We started with an easygoing idea session with the whole team where
          everyone designed some Radicle-inspired posters. This helped us get a
          sense of what the brand was from those working on it (not just me!).
          It was a really great team building exercise and also helped me get an
          idea of where to start with the brand. (Thanks Ele for the idea).

        <p>Concept 1</p>
        <p>
          The first concept was supposed to be a natural extension of the the
          style of the app. It was loosely based on the app’s icon set I drew.
          This direction reminds me of a vintage tech brand (think Apple, NeXT,
          and IBM in the 90s) which seemed to vibe with Radicle, but in the end
          felt a bit too normy and polished. I spent way too much time drawing
          these illustrations.
        </p>

        <p>Concept 2</p>
        <p>
          The second was supposed to be sort of zine-themed. Balancing a zine
          aesthetic with nice serif typography was cool, but ultimately it felt
          a bit forced and the random p2p graphics didn't really feel relevant.
          TBH I was totally trying to rip off the Boot Boyz aesthetic anyway. 👏

        <p>Concept 3</p>
        <p>
          The third one really went hard on the “coding with friends" idea. I
          even developed a character (Penty the Friendly P2P Pentagram 😅😂) but
          honestly this direction felt way too childish … kind of like a code
          school for kids or something. I still think about Penty sometimes. 🥲

        <p>Concept 4</p>
        <p>
          The last one was just bonkers. I am honestly crazy4this1. But uhh hear
          me out: what if Radicle was a cult. I might have watched too many
          documentaries on cults, idk. Conceptually the idea is pretty awful.
          (Cults are bad.) But there was something there. Think cult status.
        </p>

        <iframe
          src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/534977862?autoplay=1&amp;loop=1&amp;color=000000&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"

          allowfullscreen
        ></iframe>
        <script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

        <p>
          And we ended up going with it. This direction felt the most honest and
          raw. The aesthetic was cool but the cult imagery was awful and needed
          to change so we swapped cults for Internet art and WE GOT A BRAND©®™.

        <h2>The Website</h2>

        <p>
          While doing branding is honestly all just fun and games, we had a
          complicated p2p code collaboration ecosystem to explain. 👎 Boring
          right? No! The site then extended to explain the full ecosystem of the
          tech behind Radicle.

          We tried to avoid jargon as much as possible while still explaining
          the product in a super clear way. Abbey, Alexis, Ele, and Ange really
          nailed the copy. Paired with screenshots from the UI, it was a big
          hit. People mostly got it. Or they got distracted by the GIFs.

        <h1>The App</h1>

        <p>
          Building a peer-to-peer app is complicated. If you’re not familiar
          with the way p2p networks work, just know that in the vast majority of
          apps you use, there’s a server where everything comes from. In p2p
          apps, things are shared among people who happen to be online. That
          means information is not always the same among users. That makes for
          very complicated user experience problems.

        <p>Profile</p>
        <p>
          The profile shows the projects that you’ve created and the ones you’re
          following. Following a project begins tracking that peer, which means
          you replicate their projects to your network.

        <p>Avatars</p>
        <p>
          Since there’s no server and no way to host images, there aren’t
          traditional avatars in the app. We generate a unique emoji and color
          based on your Radice ID and display name. I think that’s pretty fun.
          In the future we’ll use the Ethereum Name Service to get avatars.

        <p>Projects</p>
        <p>
          The project page, where the repository lives, is very similar to a
          basic GitHub repository page. One challenge with this page was
          balancing things that are universal to the project, and things that
          are specific to the peer you have selected in the top right. We blur
          this difference a bit just to keep this complexity relatively easy on
          the user. For example Files and Commits are dependent on the peer you
          have selected, whereas Patches and Issues are universal.
        </p>

        <p>Issues</p>
        <p>
          The bug- and idea-tracking part of a project uses a complicated peer
          to peer replication solution called collaborative objects. Like the
          rest of the app, this p2p solution leads to situations where the user
          doesn’t have all the information. If you’ll notice one of the comments
          on this issue is by a user the app doesn’t yet have the display name
          of yet.

        <p>Patches</p>
        <p>
          Patches are Radicle’s version of Pull Requests. Our first go at
          building this feature was quite basic and didn’t include any
          commenting threading and only had a basic approval workflow. Patches
          was the first truly collaborative feature we built and we just wanted
          to get something out there that made it possible to accept open source
          contributions.
        </p>

        <h1>Design System</h1>

        <p>
          The first thing I did when I started working on Radicle was set in
          place a design system on Figma that we could easily use and work with.
          This included thinking about the system of lights and darks,
          elevation, typography, forms, and even drawing a full icon set.
        </p>

        <p>Color</p>
        <p>
          We implemented a levels system that allows us to easily add various
          themes to the app — of course dark and light mode, but easily can
          accommodate other less expected themes, like h4x0r mode, seen below.
          The color system also includes a customizable primary color which
          themes the app based on the user’s preference.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="/images/radicle/h4x0r-66d38fe3.png"
            alt="The theme set to h4x0r."
          />
          <figcaption>The theme set to h4x0r.</figcaption>

            alt="typography-tall.png"
          />
        </figure>

        <p>Typography</p>
        <p>
          The easiest way to keep the overall design of an app simple and
          straightforward is to limit the amount of type options available.
          Maintaining a lightweight type system is easier on developers and also
          easier for users to digest.
        </p>

        <h1>Icons</h1>
        <p>
          The icon system is completely custom drawn in a loose and casual
          style. Its linework relies on artful and open shapes, which feel a lot
          more exciting than typical design system icons. To the left is a
          sampling of the 90-icon set.

        <h1>Token Launch</h1>

        <p>
          When we launched our token, we launched it with a liquidity
          bootstrapping event, which required a website. This was a very
          complicated idea that required a very simple but fun website where new
          token holders could track the developing price of the new token.
