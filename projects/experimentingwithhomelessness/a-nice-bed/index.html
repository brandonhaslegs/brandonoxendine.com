        <p>
          Day 36 - Sleeping in Jen and Ryan’s guest room. Gotta stop staying
          with people. This was not the plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel very cared for when people offer to let me stay over, but I
          don’t want to do it anymore. I need to get my car fixed. I need to
          have it here in the city on weekends.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bed is nice though. I miss furniture. Never thought I would. I
          guess I like decorating places.
        </p>
