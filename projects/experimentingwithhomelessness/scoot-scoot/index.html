        <p>
          Day 44 — I bought a scooter today. Also yesterday I discovered a
          cafeteria at work that’s open on Saturdays and Sundays. So I stayed at
          work this whole weekend.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Friday I finally bought a new battery for my car, so after being
          parked in the same spot at work for weeks, I finally moved. Still not
          real comfortable driving it up to the city, so I’ll have to wait till
          I pay the $2600 to get it fixed. So not looking forward to that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, significant progress on the happiness front. Really can’t
          express how happy I am to have a scooter to ride around again. It’s so
          enjoyable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next big step: lease a private garage in the city. Not sure if I’ve
          typed out my official plan for car logistics yet, so here it is: park
          my car in my leased garage during the days, and drive it to some safe
          neighborhood to sleep at night. I don’t want to sleep in the garage
          because I feel like the owner would expect something like that, and
          would check. Will inevitably sleep in the garage a few times though.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next small step: buy $75 scooter rack for trailer hitch on my car.
          Then I’ll be able to take my house and my scoot with me anywhere! The
          dream.
        </p>
