        <p>
          On one hand, you want to respect stakeholder feedback because you know
          they often have valuable insights. On the other hand, their feedback
          can sometimes feel like a never-ending list of demands that can derail
          your design vision. 🌠 Well, here are some things that worked for me.

        <p>
          When onboarding designers to a new team, making them feel welcome and
          fully prepared to do their job can dramatically improve their
          performance and feeling about their new job. This is my checklist.

        <p>
          For most of my career, I’ve believed that Design Sprints were a
          bullshit way of getting a bunch of people in a room and doing a bunch
          of talking and exercises that lead to nothing. I think I thought of
          them this way because everything I read about them online, or saw on
          YouTube was masturbatory Silicon Valley jargon.

          It’s a struggle joining a new team, especially when you’re meant to
          lead it. I documented my ideal first year as a design team lead for my
          own reference and thought I’d share it for yours.

          The more I’ve worked in product design with startups, the more I’ve
          realized there’s no real process to follow. Every challenge is
          different and you really never know what’s around the corner. But if I
          were to define my rough process for effectively shipping quality
          products, this would be it.

        <p>
          I haven’t reflected on the digital products I’m using in a little
          while. (In the last few years I’ve been super focused on the physical
          things I own, on My Collection of Things) I sat down to write a little
          bit about my three favorite digital products that are a part of my
          daily life, Figma, Google Photos, and Telegram.

        <p>
          In 2014 I started my first managerial role, managing the design team
          at Fuzzco. I always felt like I could be a good boss, but it really
          tested my limits emotionally and surprised me with the amount of work
          involved. Here are some things I’ve learned managing small teams of
          designers.

          it’s good enough for digital design.
