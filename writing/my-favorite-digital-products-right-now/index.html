          I haven’t reflected on the digital products I’m using in a little
          while. (In the last few years I’ve been super focused on the physical
          things I own, on
          <a href="/collections/my-collection-of-things" target="_blank"
            >My Collection of Things</a
          >) I sat down to write a little bit about my three favorite digital
          products that are a part of my daily life, Figma, Google Photos, and
          Telegram.

          <h2><strong>Figma</strong></h2>
          <p>
            <br />Realtime collaboration between designers changed my life. I
            really swear, I think Figma is the best thing that’s ever happened
            to design in my design career. It’s the app we’ve all been waiting
            for. It’s the app we talked about back in 2011 when we were still
            considering if Illustrator or Photoshop or Dreamweaver or Fireworks
            was the best for designing apps and websites (I wrote why
            Illustrator was the best back then
            <a href="/writing/why-i-design-for-the-web-in-illustrator">here</a
            >). Figma is the answer. It’s a web app—wait what—yeah Figma is a
            web app: you can go to Figma.com, sign in, and see all your projects
            and jump right back in where you left off. There’s no saving your
            work, it’s always saved, always there. When you want to share
            something, you just copy the link and send it to someone. It’s
            insanely easy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like listen, if you've never co-designed something with another
            designer at the same time, in the same file, you have to try it.
            It's incredible. I’m talking two (or three, four, five?) cursors in
            the same document working with the same elements all at the same
            time, with zero lag. Listen, I know this sounds a bit stressful and
            it’s not the primary reason I love Figma, but you really gotta try
            it with a designer you trust. If you already work well with someone,
            adding real time collaboration is euphoric.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re really into design systems, Figma is set up for them.
            They’re super easy to set up and use right away across the whole
            team, and they’re just so convenient. I’m talking changes appearing
            in real-time, shared typography styles, fills (including gradients,
            textures, image fills, multi-color fills). And check it out, if you
            love the perfect design system you’ve built on Figma, brush up on
            your coding skills or pair up with your favorite front end engineer
            and you can literally hook your design system in Figma up to your
            actual app and any time you make a change to the typography, colors,
            icons, anything, it updates in your real design system immediately.
            This straight up ain’t child’s play no more.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re worried about using a web app to do all your design, I get
            it. The most annoying thing about Figma is that it takes a little
            while for documents to first load. But once they’re loaded, there’s
            zero lag moving around huge images or illustrations with thousands
            of points. (Looking at you Illustrator and Sketch) And speaking of
            points, I’m totally shook admitting this as a big
            <a href="/collections/letters">pen tool nerd</a>, but Figma has the
            best pen tool ever made. Trust me, you gotta try it. There’s a tiny
            learning curve because it doesn’t work exactly like Illustrator (in
            mostly good ways), but the improvements and innovations they’ve made
            on the pen tool alone are good enough reasons to use Figma. I’ve
            done logo projects, lettering, illustration—it’s all gravy,
            seriously.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, try <a href="http://figma.com" target="_blank">Figma</a>
          </p>
          <h2><strong>Google Photos</strong></h2>
          <p>
            <br />This was the first real photos product to really wow me with
            the things they were doing with your photo library (please set aside
            the comments about Google and privacy for a minute as we discuss
            this great product). I'd heard about a lot of web-based photo
            library products in the past that promised various magical things,
            but Google Photos really delivered that magical things. I think they
            were the first photo product to tag and organize your photos based
            on the people in them (🤫 psht—no, we’ll discuss privacy later, this
            feature is cool in this utopic world we’re chilling in right now).
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to organizing by people’s faces, it’s Google, there’s a
            prominent search bar at the top. You can search for “breakfast” or
            “party” or “street” or ANYTHING and Google will show you photos from
            your library that match that search. Okay, I hate when people
            describe engineering as magic (looking at you product managers) but
            y’all… this shit is magic. I use this all the time. Wanna see photos
            from May 2015? Type it in, done.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you may have noticed with Figma, I prefer web-based products.
            There’s something so beautiful about apps that live directly on the
            web. There’s no prerequisite for using them. You don’t have to own a
            6,000 dollar computer, or a 1,000 dollar phone! You just go to the
            URL, log in, and your stuff’s all there. It’s beautiful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking of the idealistic free web, the freemium model for Google
            Photos is also brilliant. Like, I know, they can only offer this
            insane service and cloud photo storage for free because it’s Google,
            but still, it’s a beautiful thing that anyone can use this for free.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re not using it yet and uh, you don’t mind giving literally
            all your private photos to Google, try
            <a href="http://photos.google.com" target="_blank">Google Photos</a
            >.
          </p>
          <h2><strong>Telegram</strong></h2>
          <p>
            <br />Yo, there are sooo many messaging apps. I feel dumb even
            recommending another one. But really, Telegram is the best one. I’m
            100% confident in saying that it’s the best one. I’m talking from a
            product perspective—they ship features regularly and at consistent
            quality. From a design perspective—the app is well designed,
            interactions are thoughtful, power-user friendly, and natural. From
            a fun perspective— they have the best stickers, because it’s a open
            market where anyone can upload sticker packs (from Bob’s favorite
            memes, to indie illustrators releasing their own creations, to like…
            illustrations that someone ripped from some publication from the
            middle ages. Finally, they’re serious about new technologies. They
            just did their ICO, and their code is open source.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s also nice that they're not owned by a huge company and they're
            totally focused on messaging. It’s not a spin off like Messenger
            (Owned by Facebook), it’s not a feature of another app (Instagram,
            owned by Facebook), it’s not a horrible app that everyone on earth
            just happens to use (WhatsApp, owned by Facebook), it’s not a
            platform-specific system (iMessage), and it’s … what the hell does
            Google even offer? It’s not that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, It’s been fun converting all my friends to Telegram. No one
            looks back.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re still searching for the perfect messaging app, try
            <a href="http://telegram.org" target="_blank">Telegram</a>.
