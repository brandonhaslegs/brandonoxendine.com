  <p>Basically I buy books that look good 📖 that I hope also have great content. There is mostly a correlation, I’ve found. But I mean really we all get our recipes from the internet 💻 so recipe books are just nice to have around the house, and they might as well look good.</p><p>This one has a bunch of impossible French recipes acompanied by a simple layout and classic, nice recipe book photography. It also has a super nice soft (pillowy? squishy?) hardcover which is really nice.</p><p>🇺🇸&nbsp;<a href="http://amzn.to/2qedSIj" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.com</a></p><p>🇩🇪&nbsp;<a href="http://amzn.to/2q4XydW" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.de</a></p><p>🇨🇦&nbsp;<a href="http://amzn.to/2qe7gKa" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.ca</a></p>
