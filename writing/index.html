      <p>On one hand, you want to respect stakeholder feedback because you know they often have valuable insights. On the other hand, their feedback can sometimes feel like a never-ending list of demands that can derail your design vision. 🌠 Well, here are some things that worked for me.</p>

      <p>When onboarding designers to a new team, making them feel welcome and fully prepared to do their job can dramatically improve their performance and feeling about their new job. This is my checklist.</p>

      <p>For most of my career, I’ve believed that Design Sprints were a bullshit way of getting a bunch of people in a room and doing a bunch of talking and exercises that lead to nothing. I think I thought of them this way because everything I read about them online, or saw on YouTube was masturbatory Silicon Valley jargon.</p>

      <p>It’s a struggle joining a new team, especially when you’re meant to lead it. I documented my ideal first year as a design team lead for my own reference and thought I’d share it for yours.</p>

      <p>The more I’ve worked in product design with startups, the more I’ve realized there’s no real process to follow. Every challenge is different and you really never know what’s around the corner. But if I were to define my rough process for effectively shipping quality products, this would be it.</p>

      <p>I haven’t reflected on the digital products I’m using in a little while. (In the last few years I’ve been super focused on the physical things I own, on My Collection of Things) I sat down to write a little bit about my three favorite digital products that are a part of my daily life, Figma, Google Photos, and Telegram.</p>

      <p>In 2014 I started my first managerial role, managing the design team at Fuzzco. I always felt like I could be a good boss, but it really tested my limits emotionally and surprised me with the amount of work involved. Here are some things I’ve learned managing small teams of designers.</p>
