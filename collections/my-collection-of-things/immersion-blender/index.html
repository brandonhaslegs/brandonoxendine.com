          I love blendy things. 🌀 I always knew I needed the Cuisinart food
          processor in my kitchen. Learned that from every mom ever. But what I
          never really knew I NEEDED in my kitchen was a simple immersion
          blender. These things are a fraction of the price of a food processor
          or a blender, and they’re super versatile. I use mine almost every day
          to make purées. It’s nice to use an immersion blender because you just
          stick it in whatever pot, pan, or bowl your food is in. With blenders
          and food processors you got a whole army of parts to wash afterwards.

          Also worth noting: I never believed a friend about these things. She
          always said you gotta get one, and I was like, eh I mean do they
          really blend everything together? It looks so small and powerless?
          They do. She was right.
