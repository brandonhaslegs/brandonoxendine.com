  <p>I love these candles. Admittedly, it’s better to go into the Candlefish store in Charleston, South Carolina if you can and sniff like a million candles (ok there are only 100 scents in their library… but 100!!), but also they’re all generally great-smelling candles, so just go with your gut and choose a scent that sounds good. Since they’re Candlefish’s own collection, I think they try to keep the cost as low as possible. I think 22 bucks for a nice, relatively large, candle is pretty good. Also the design of the label isn’t dumb, it has gold ink 🤤&nbsp;an embossed gold logo (designed by Fuzzco, where I used to work), and the volume checkbox is hand-ticked, which is a nice touch.</p>

  <p>BIG TIP: I use the glasses from these 🕯 candles as my regular 🥃 drinking glasses. They are, in my opinion, the best glasses for drinking. Simple, straight sides, relatively thin glass thickness, good volume for a glass of water, and also hefty enough to make a cocktail look nice. Whiskey looks fantastic in this glass.</p><p>🇺🇸&nbsp;<a href="http://amzn.to/2o23giG" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.com</a></p><p>🇨🇦 <a href="http://amzn.to/2pdwDiX" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.ca</a></p>
