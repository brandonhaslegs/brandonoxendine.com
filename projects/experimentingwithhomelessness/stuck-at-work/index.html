        <p>
          Day 66 — An awkward situation I’ve frequently been running into is
          working late. Busses from work stop running after about 9:30, so if I
          work past that time I have to explain to people that I don’t need a
          ride home to the city, that “I’ll just drive home.” I think I’ve
          declined enough rides to cement my position of never accepting rides
          home, but it can still get hairy sometimes. Take this one particular
          night, where my team was working late, and there was a few folks from
          the group who lived in the city who were counting on getting a ride
          home from the fellow city dwellers who drove to work that day.
          Consider the situation I’m in: I either say A) I don’t have my car
          today so I too need a ride “home” to the city, B) I have my car so I
          can drop someone off at their house on the way to mine. Either
          situation has me going up to the city where I do not need to go.
          Somehow I got out of this situation, but I got real nervous when it
          happened. Hoping it doesn’t happen again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another realization: there are so few things you can buy when you live
          in your car. No furniture, only a certain amount of clothes (I need to
          get rid of a lot), no extra gadgets, no kitchen supplies, nothing. I’m
          actually starting to save money. Of course, it can all be blown in one
          flight with a couple nights of expensive food and drink. But I’m
          trying to avoid that. My technique so far has been to work 7 days a
          week. I feel like a monk. I work, sleep, and eat in pretty much the
          same building. It’s a very strange feeling. Can’t believe it’s been 2
          months.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, no real complications to report. I’m sure this journey would
          be a bit more interesting if I was living in the city in my car. Still
          figuring if I want to do that or just stay down in the valley in the
          secured parking lot.
        </p>
        <p>What a bore I am.</p>
