  <p>I never could find a dish drying rack I liked. They always seem so cheap and flimsy. Occasionally I see one 🔎 online 💻 that’s really designery and simple, but things like that are always hard to actually buy IRL.</p><p>This one from Dille &amp; Kamille is a nice mix of sturdy, wood (something you rarely see in drying racks), foldable, and visually pleasing. It's nice to have a bit of wood in the kitchen. It's not huge, but it'll easily hold two nights of cookware, 🍽 dishes, silverware, and ☕️ cups.</p><p>On a side note: Dille &amp; Kamille is really great. If you live in Germany or The Netherlands you gotta check out this store and order some stuff. They have lots of nice simple, affordable homewares (read: lots of kitchen stuff).</p><p>🇩🇪 <a href="https://www.dille-kamille.de/de/shop/c/504/a/202/grosses-abtropfgestell-aus-kautschukholz/" target="_blank">Buy on Dille-Kamille.de</a></p>
