  <p>I have a Google Home House. 🤓 In my tiny apartment, I’ve insisted that we have three Google Home Minis and one Google Home Hub. One in each room, that’s how it’s supposed to work, right? 💁‍♂️ These little devices, while obviously not the best sound quality, are just so cute and so useful to have around the house. I of course made sure to buy one in each color. The coral one is in the living room (stylish), the charcoal one is in the kitchen (utilitarian, matches the kitchen appliances), and the grey one in the bedroom (the last color left).</p>
