          Even though everyone hates long lines, we still like to go to popular
          places. And most people would like to know before they go somewhere if
          there’s a line or not there. Whether it’s a club, a popular food
          chain, or at a release of a new Nike shoe, this web app is a simple
          solution to finding out if you should go or not.
