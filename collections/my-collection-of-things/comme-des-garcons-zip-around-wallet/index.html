          I first saw this wallet when one of my friends pulled it out years ago
          and it’s been on my wishlist since. I thought it was so great that
          it’s so compact, still fits in my pocket but makes room for lots of
          storage. 🗄️ Finally I got it for my birthday. 🎁 What I really love
          about this one is that has a super low profile from the outside, but
          the inside is bright blue. 🖤💙 Also nice that it zips completely
          closed, so you can just stuff stuff inside of it and zip it closed and
          it won’t fall out. It’s exactly the size of a passport too 🛂 so even
          though it’s not meant for it, you can just barely fit a passport
          inside of it and zip it closed.
        </p>

          Unfortunately it’s fashion, so the day after this came out there was a
          new version and the blue interior was only availble for 5 seconds in a
          special fashion week capsule dump on Friday the 13th or something.
          Anyway I tried finding similar ones:
