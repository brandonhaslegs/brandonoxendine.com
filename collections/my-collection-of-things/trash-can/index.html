          I’ve struggled with trash cans in my life. 😐 I don’t think I ever had
          a good one until this year when I got this one. But this one is great!
          At first I sort of didn’t like the big foot pedal, but now I actually
          think it looks kind of industrial crank-turn-ish. Also everything
          about this is super solid and I’m pretty sure it will never break. I
          avoided simplehuman for a long time because 1) they’re friggin
          expensive and 2) it just felt extremely bland? Kind of like OXO? But
          this one has proved to be very good and I think it looks quite nice.
          Also it has this feature where you can rest the inner container on a
          little lip inside while you change the bag out 👌 which is actually
          very very helpful.

          Tip: stay away from a trash can you can’t open with your foot. Ya just
          gotta have a pedal. You don’t want to be waving your hand, or pressing
          a button, or taking off a lid when you’re carrying something gross and
          wet across the kitchen.

          Another tip: never ever get
          <a href="http://amzn.to/2oEIiHc" target="_blank">this one</a> it is
          literally the worst ever and I hate that I owned it at one point. 🤦‍♂️
