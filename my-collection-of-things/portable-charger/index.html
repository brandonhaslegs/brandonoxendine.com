  <p>Alright, so I’m kind of obsessed with having portable batteries with me. I carry this one in a black string backpack with me everywhere. I have offered a charging cord to so many people in a club at 4 in the morning—it’s very handy. I highly recommend my always-charged 🔋 lifestyle. It’s also nice to always be able to leave the house without worrying if my phone is charged. This thing holds about 4 or 5 full phone charges, so I have rarely been in a situation where it doesn’t last long enough for one outing (or trip through multiple airports, a 3-day festival, a picnic). Also it looks like a Rimowa suitcase so yeah…</p>

  <p>Note: it’s regrettably not actual metal, it’s painted plastic, which kinda sucks because it wears off around the edges eventually and it's not a great look. But I still recommend it. There’s also an <a href="http://amzn.to/2nICwDd" target="_blank">all-black version</a> that looks pretty hot.&nbsp;I also have <a href="http://amzn.to/2nbG8KT" target="_blank">this portable charger</a>, but it’s a bit too techy for my taste.</p><p>🇺🇸&nbsp;<a href="http://amzn.to/2o3M3FC" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.com</a></p><p>🇩🇪&nbsp;<a href="http://amazon.de/dp/B014RBEH6U" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.de</a></p><p>🇨🇦 <a href="http://amzn.to/2pOk1el" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.ca</a></p>
