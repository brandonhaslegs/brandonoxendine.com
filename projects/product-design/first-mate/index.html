      <p>
        FirstMate is an app where users can recruit their friends to keep them
        accountable for achieving their goals through regular check-ins. Users
        set goals then choose a life coach or a friend to keep them motivated.
        The coach or friend checks in regularly with the user to make sure
        they’re completing their tasks and staying on track to achieve their
        goals.

          The app is meant to feel very simple and easy to use, so we leaned on
          a lot of native app standards. This helps to make things feel familiar
          to users and helps the app feel more trustworthy.

          The user receives digital "stickers" each time they check in and the
          coach or friend determines the user has successfully achieved a goal.
          The freemium model allows users to use the app with friends without
          being obligated to pay. In the freemium model, we rely on the value
          and strength of personal friendships to achieve goals.

          The website needed to be very clear and to the point. It needed to
          feel trustworthy and like something solid that you could rely on—like
          a friend. I designed and built the website to be light and easy to
          use, and wrote the copy with the founder in a way that hoped to best
          promote sign-ups.
