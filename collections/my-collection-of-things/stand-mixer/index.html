          I actually got the Breville Stand Mixer for free, using United
          MileagePlus points, 💸 but I did pick it out and so I do recommend it.
          Here are some things I like about it:
        </p>
        <ul>

            <p>
              The timer function is great. It starts the timer automatically
              when you start the mixer, so if you have to mix something for a
              certain amount of time, you don’t have to worry about setting
              timers or forgetting when you started mixing. It’s even good for
              small amounts of time, since you just don’t have to think about
              it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The scraper attachment is cool. It scrapes dough off the bowl as
              it stirs. It doesn’t always work perfectly, but it’s definitely a
              nice feature.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The electronic dial 🎛 and light-up levels 🎚 are handy if you’re
              not a pro and don't know the difference between “cream” and
              “aerate.” I do worry about the machine having the main function
              controlled by an electronic piece though… don’t electronics always
              break?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          BTW the clear plastic thing around the bowl (not pictured) is stupid,
          ugly, and flimsy. 🚮 Throw it away.

          I know this isn’t
          <a href="http://amzn.to/2nF0Ky1" target="_blank"
            >the KitchenAid mixer</a
          >
          that everyone agrees is the best, but I really do prefer this one—it
          feels a bit techy, which is kinda my thing. So despite KitchenAid’s
          mixer being “the best,” I was always turned off by the vintage look of
          it. Also KitchenAid’s logo is hella bad—Breville’s is nice IMHO don’t
          @ me.
