          Happy to have received something out of my Wishlist for my birthday.
          😊 Lodge is the default for cast iron. I know there are some
          nice-looking Cast Iron Grills out there (<a

            target="_blank"
            >love the simplicity of this one</a
          >) but I feel like Lodge is the one you’re supposed to get. I kinda
          like the ugly logo on there too 🤷‍♂️ whatever.

          In use, this thing is such a game-changer. Like, you can grill
          basically any time for any meal, which is amazing. If you haven’t
          cooked on cast iron before, it’s also a totally different kind of
          cooking. Meats cook easier and more like they’re supposed to, breads
          toast up really nice. You just gotta watch the temperature a bit
          because this thing gets and stays really hot.

          BTW: I have a ceramic stovetop 🙄 and this works just fine. I don’t
          think it would work on induction, but it works totally fine on the
          ceramic stovetop.
