          Let’s be honest who <em>likes</em> feedback? Getting feedback
          suuuuucks. I’m reminded of the story of Paul Rand designing the NEXT
          branding for $100,000 in 1985.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I asked him if he would come up with a few options, and he said, ‘No,
          I will solve your problem for you and you will pay me. You don’t have
          to use the solution. If you want options go talk to other people.’”
        </p>
        <p>— Steve Jobs</p>
        <p>That rocks. But we’re not Paul Rand.</p>
        <p>
          On one hand, you want to respect stakeholder feedback because you
          <em>know</em> they often have valuable insights. On the other hand,
          their feedback can sometimes feel like a never-ending list of demands
          that can derail your design vision. 🌠 Well, here are some things that
          worked for me.
        </p>
        <h3>Understanding the Stakeholder Perspective</h3>
        <p>
          First things first: put yourself in their shoes. 👠 Stakeholders
          usually have a vested interest in the project’s success. They’re
          looking out for the company’s best interests, which maybe your little
          pea design brain isn’t. No offense I’m just saying. Been there done
          that. Understanding this can help you approach their feedback with
          empathy rather than frustration.
        </p>
        <h3>Setting Clear Expectations</h3>
        <p>
          Before diving into the design process, set clear expectations with
          your stakeholders. Explain your process, timelines, and the kind of
          feedback you’ll need at each stage. This helps prevent last-minute
          surprises 🫨 and sets the tone for constructive feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe try creating a feedback guide. Outline what kind of feedback is
          useful at different stages of the project. For example, early feedback
          should focus on concept and strategy, while later feedback can address
          finer details.
        </p>
        <h3>Structured Feedback Sessions</h3>
        <p>
          Unstructured feedback can be a nightmare. 👹 Instead, schedule
          structured feedback sessions where stakeholders can review the work
          and provide their input. This can be done through design reviews or
          dedicated feedback meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’d recommend using a structured format for these sessions. For
          example, start with a brief presentation of the design, followed by a
          Q&amp;A, and then open the floor for feedback. This keeps the session
          focused and productive.
        </p>
        <h3>Active Listening</h3>
        <p>
          When receiving feedback, listen actively. This means not just hearing
          the words, but understanding the underlying concerns and motivations.
          Ask clarifying questions and take notes. This shows stakeholders that
          you value their input and are taking it seriously. Also good life tip.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, paraphrase their feedback to ensure you’ve understood it
          correctly. This also gives them a chance to refine their thoughts if
          necessary.
        </p>
        <h3>Prioritizing Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          Not all feedback is created equal. Some suggestions will be crucial,
          while others might be nice-to-haves or even counterproductive.
          Prioritize feedback based on how well it aligns with your project
          goals and user needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try using FigJam to create a “feedback matrix” to categorize feedback
          into must-haves, should-haves, could-haves, and won’t-haves. This
          helps in managing and prioritizing feedback effectively.
        </p>
        <h3>Balancing Stakeholder and User Needs</h3>
        <p>
          Sometimes, stakeholder feedback can conflict with user needs. In such
          cases, it’s important to advocate for the user. 🧍‍♀️ Use data and user
          research to back up your decisions. Explain to stakeholders the impact
          of their suggestions on the user experience. This can help them
          understand your perspective better!
        </p>
        <p>
          In these cases, be sure to share user personas, journey maps, and
          usability test results with stakeholders. 📑 This data-driven approach
          can make a strong case for why certain feedback may or may not be
          implemented.
        </p>
        <h3>Clear and Open Communication</h3>
        <p>
          Keep the lines of communication open. Regular updates and progress
          reports can help keep stakeholders informed and engaged. This reduces
          the likelihood of unexpected feedback late in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use tools like Slack or project management software to keep
          stakeholders in the loop. Regular status meetings or progress emails
          can also be effective. Heck I’ve even been known to invite outsiders
          to design crits sometimes. Make them feel special, make them feel
          involved in the process.
        </p>
        <h3>Managing Difficult Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          You’ll surely encounter difficult feedback that feels unhelpful or
          misguided on your journey to ✨mastering feedback✨ so in these
          situations try stay calm, remember we are thankfully not doctors, and
          stay professional. Acknowledge the feedback, explain your reasoning,
          and if necessary, suggest a compromise.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the feedback is non-negotiable and I disagree, I always try to
          remember that all ideas are valid and a lot of things you can make
          work if you really have to. Also sometimes, a small tweak can satisfy
          stakeholders without a major overhaul. The disaster scenario could
          just all be in your head. Try it out!
        </p>
        <h3>But why can’t I be Paul Rand</h3>
        <p>
          I mean I guess you can, do whatever you want. But handling stakeholder
          feedback doesn’t have to be a headache. 🤕 By setting clear
          expectations, actively listening, prioritizing feedback, and keeping
          communication open, you can turn potentially stressful situations into
          productive collaborations. Remember, the goal is to create the best
          possible product, and constructive stakeholder feedback is a valuable
          part of that process.
