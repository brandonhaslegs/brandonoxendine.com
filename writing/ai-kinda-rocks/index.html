          Is anyone writing about how incredible AI is? I feel like all I read is people 
          plugging their ears and boycotting anything semi related. People are so
          focused on the concerns that they’re ignoring the massive advancement
          in human knowledge and productivity we’re living through. Ignoring it
          feels so disingenuous.
        </p>

        <p>
          A (non-tech) friend recently told me she’s using ChatGPT to build her
          own apps for calorie/protein counting and budgeting. Another group of friends I work out with
          started a ChatGPT group chat to manage our schedules so we can work
          out together without the endless back-and-forth.
        </p>
		<p>
		  AI has replaced so many apps in my life. I love it. Like yeah, it’s awful
		  for all those apps I used to use, but I think a positive shift for
		  users and a negative shift for companies is a net good thing. I’m not
		  sure what’s gonna happen to the economy, but for me, it’s great. Sorry
		  shareholders, I guess.
		</p>
        <p>
          We’re moving into a world where anyone can build things. Development
          is extremely cheap now, which necessarily opens massive doors. This surely will bring about a new age of geocities-esque websites right? Random ass people just coding whatever they damn well please? Yes, please!
        </p>
	

        <p>
          All my developer friends are building with AI now. Some moved
          exclusively to using AI agents. They’ve even told me they don't care
          about “readable code” anymore because the agents don't care. That’s
          kind of scary, but it’s a massive change worth considering when you say we're “in an AI bubble.”
		  Someone I was talking to recently told me it already feels wild that we used to write code. Like we just lived through the industrial revolution of programming. We used to be out here writing artisanal handcrafted code. And hey sorry bud but I think The Industrial Revolution was good!
        </p>


        <p>
          But like I’m not saying AI is universally good. It’s terrible in so many ways. And sad. And I loathe to think what kind of mush our brains are turning to (Let's hope we're just rewiring?)
          But the upside is too big to be ignored. It’s a real shift in human
          intelligence and productivity, and someone needs to be talking about
          it. So I wrote this.
