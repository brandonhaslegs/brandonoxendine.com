<img src="/images/alcohol-aalborg-akvavit/image-asset-688b0796.png" alt="Aalborg Akvavit">
      <h2>Aalborg Akvavit</h2>
      <p>I’ll be honest with this you, this tastes disgusting. You gotta be looking for something real dank to drink this.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol-absolut-elyx/Vodka-Absolut-Elyx-3134a63c.png" alt="Absolut Elyx">
      <h2>Absolut Elyx</h2>
      <p>I think this is the best vodka. I don't care that it's from Absolut. It's the best. I will always buy it.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">

      <h2>Angostura Orange Bitters</h2>

<img src="/images/alcohol-aperol/image-asset-f1359114.png" alt="Aperol">
      <h2>Aperol</h2>

    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol-atenco-espann/image-asset-8fb1b316.png" alt="Atenco Espanín">
      <h2>Atenco Espanín</h2>
      <p>Listen, I love mezcal. I’m annoyed by how little there is in my collection, but it’s so hard to find in Berlin! I got this one at a craft spirits festival in Berlin a few years back. It’s awesome.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">

      <h2>Bas-Armagnac Domaine “Le Basque” 2000</h2>
      <p>I’m not sure I really understand what Armagnac is. I love the undesigned simplicity of this bottle. The taste is really mild.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/benedictine.png" alt="Benedictine">
      <h2>Benedictine</h2>
      <p>This is a strange liqueur. Pretty sweet, so it’s easy to combine in cocktails.</p>

<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/buffalo-trace.png" alt="Buffalo Trace">
      <h2>Buffalo Trace</h2>
      <p>Standard fare. Some people keep this as their standard drinkin’ bourbon. It’s fine.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/bulleit-bourbon.png" alt="Bulleit Bourbon">
      <h2>Bulleit Bourbon</h2>
      <p>Once I had a blind whiskey tasting party with 10 of my friends. With bottles from 15 to 75 euros, Bulleit won the taste test. I love it. I drink it all the time.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/bulleit-rye.png" alt="Bulleit Rye">
      <h2>Bulleit Rye</h2>
      <p>A great standard to have around. I prefer bourbon, but gotta have rye around too, and this is a good one.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/campari.png" alt="Campari">
      <h2>Campari</h2>
      <p>Much less basic than Aperol, but similar vibe and same pretty color.</p>

<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/cave-creek.png" alt="Cave Creek">
      <h2>Cave Creek</h2>

    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/chantre.png" alt="Chantré">
      <h2>Chantré</h2>
      <p>Cheap brandy that’s nice to put in mulled wine. Nothing more, but always have it on hand in Winter.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/cherry-heering.png" alt="Cherry Heering">
      <h2>Cherry Heering</h2>
      <p>When you gotta have some gnarly sweet cherry flavor in a drink, Cherry Heering is your stuff.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/clement-125th-anniversary-agricole-rhum.png" alt="Clement 125th Anniversary Agricole Rhum">
      <h2>Clement 125th Anniversary Agricole Rhum</h2>
      <p>I bought this one at a store down the street from me. Weird, in a street full of mostly apartments, there's a Rum Agricole store. The guy in the store is really nice and talkative. Also funny, this is the Clement (fancy brand) 125th Anniversary edition bottle… this is what they chose. 🤷‍♂️</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/cointreau.png" alt="Cointreau">
      <h2>Cointreau</h2>
      <p>Gotta have it for margaritas. Olé bitch. I rarely use it for anything else. It’s extremely sweet and orangey.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/creme-de-cacao.png" alt="Creme de Cacao">
      <h2>Creme de Cacao</h2>
      <p>Here’s and extremely lame bottle of Creme de Cacao. But honestly it’s what I use. It’s awesome in coffee, or to add a strange hint of chocolate to cocktails.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/cuate-1-year.png" alt="Cuate 1 Year">
      <h2>Cuate 1 Year</h2>
      <p>This is the cheapest of the Cuate's. Berlin-based company, which is cool. The packaging ain't bad either. Nice to have around.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/cuate-13-year.png" alt="Cuate 13 Year">
      <h2>Cuate 13 Year</h2>
      <p>The crème de la crème from Coate. This one is excellent. 👌 Also not super expensive…&nbsp;maybe I have bad taste in rum. I love this one.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/cuate-4-year.png" alt="Cuate 4 Year">
      <h2>Cuate 4 Year</h2>
      <p>Nice mid-grade dark rum. Another from Cuate, which means the bottle is nice to look at and it’s in every Berlin bar.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/cynar.png" alt="Cynar">
      <h2>Cynar</h2>
      <p>I love Cynar. Put it on ice with a lemon wedge and sip it at a club on the cheap. And it’s made from friggin artichokes!? Mama mia!</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/dolin-red.png" alt="Dolin Red">
      <h2>Dolin Red</h2>
      <p>Pretty standard stuff here. I mean it's the fancy standard stuff but nothing groundbreaking. Better keep scrolling.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/espolon-blanco-tequila.png" alt="Espolon Blanco Tequila">
      <h2>Espolon Blanco Tequila</h2>
      <p>I got this as a gift once. It was one of my first real bottles of nice liquor. The packaging is great (love the fluorescent lettering) and it's a good tequila.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/fernet-branca.png" alt="Fernet Branca">
      <h2>Fernet Branca</h2>
      <p>Chefs drink it so I drink it, lol. But really, I love the stuff. It’s fun to make complex deep cocktails with a fernet base.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/grand-marnier.png" alt="Grand Marnier">
      <h2>Grand Marnier</h2>
      <p>I really dunno why I have this, but my dad always uses it on Thanksgiving to season a turkey. And there's a wax seal on it. idk, nothing special…</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/green-chartreuse.png" alt="Green Chartreuse">
      <h2>Green Chartreuse</h2>
      <p>This stuff is so green! I initially bought it to make a cocktail that lights on fire… oh right it lights on fire. Badass.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/hakushu-12-whisky.png" alt="Hakushu 12 Whisky">
      <h2>Hakushu 12 Whisky</h2>
      <p>I got this as a gift for Christmas one year. It's a really fancyish whisky. It's usually in bars where they have a Japanese whisky selection. Love a Japanese label.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/hse-rhum-agricole-blanc.png" alt="HSE Rhum Agricole Blanc">
      <h2>HSE Rhum Agricole Blanc</h2>
      <p>Got this Rum Agricole at the store down the street. The first night I bought it, I drank a little too much and went absolutely nuts. I don't recommend that. It's very high ABV and I did not realize that.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/hudson-baby-bourbon.png" alt="Hudson Baby Bourbon">
      <h2>Hudson Baby Bourbon</h2>
      <p>One of the most delicious bourbons I’ve tasted. Whenever I have this around, it’s a treat.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/hudson-double-charred-whiskey.png" alt="Hudson Double Charred Whiskey">
      <h2>Hudson Double Charred Whiskey</h2>
      <p>Hudson is just great. This was a special run (I think?) that I picked up a while back. A bit deeper flavor but pretty standard I'd say. Looks more intense than it is.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/jj-kurberg-chilli-pipar-vodka.png" alt="J.J. Kurberg Chilli Pipar Vodka">
      <h2>J.J. Kurberg Chilli Pipar Vodka</h2>
      <p>Another one from the Craft Spirits Festival in Berlin. This one is great. Nice little spicy bite. Very pretty bottle if you're into the apothecary vibe.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/jagermeister.png" alt="Jagermeister">
      <h2>Jagermeister</h2>
      <p>🤷‍♂️ I think Jagermeister is fine.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/joyas-oaxaquenas.png" alt="Joyas Oaxaqueñas">
      <h2>Joyas Oaxaqueñas</h2>
      <p>This is a pretty nice mezcal. I remember others from this label being a bit better but much more expensive (so is mezcal in Berlin…).</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/junipero-genevieve.png" alt="Junipero Genevieve">
      <h2>Junipero Genevieve</h2>
      <p>I learned about Jenever in Amsterdam. It’s very Dutch. This one is made by Anchor in San Francisco and is pretty nice. Not a normal sort of flavor, gotta be ready for a kick.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/junipero-gin.png" alt="Junipero Gin">
      <h2>Junipero Gin</h2>
      <p>This is an excellent gin. It was my favorite for many years. They changed the label in the last few years and I just can’t look at it anymore. but I’m sure the gin is still great.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/kahlua.png" alt="Kahlúa">
      <h2>Kahlúa</h2>
      <p>There are much better coffee liqueurs. But… I have this in my collection.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/knob-creek.png" alt="Knob Creek">
      <h2>Knob Creek</h2>
      <p>Standard stuff. Worth having around I guess.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/kr-23.png" alt="KR/23">
      <h2>KR/23</h2>
      <p>This is an herbal liqueur, like Jägermeister. Made in Berlin and has a nice label and cool name, so I guess that’s good. It’s really tasty.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/kuemmerling.png" alt="Kuemmerling">
      <h2>Kuemmerling</h2>
      <p>This is like Jägermeister but even more German. It’s nice after a big meal.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/lagavulin-16.png" alt="Lagavulin 16">
      <h2>Lagavulin 16</h2>
      <p>Just excellent Scotch. You really can't go wrong with this. It's a beautiful bottle, tastes incredible, makes a great gift. It's 16 goddam years old.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/laphroaig-10.png" alt="Laphroaig 10">
      <h2>Laphroaig 10</h2>
      <p>Another very nice scotch. I don't have many but those I do have are great. You'll sometimes see this for 10 bucks a shot in clubs. I've done it. Sometimes you want scotch, man.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/letherbee-besk.png" alt="Letherbee Bësk">
      <h2>Letherbee Bësk</h2>
      <p>This stuff is soooo gnarly. Like it’s straight up real nasty. Originally Letherbee brought it out as “Malort”&nbsp;the classic Chicago shot, but they got sued so it’s called Bësk now.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/letherbee-charred-oak-absinthe.png" alt="Letherbee Charred Oak Absinthe">
      <h2>Letherbee Charred Oak Absinthe</h2>
      <p>This is my favorite absinthe. I’ve had the same bottle for years. Nice to drip over a cocktail to make it more interesting.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/letherbee-fernet.png" alt="Letherbee Fernet">
      <h2>Letherbee Fernet</h2>
      <p>This fernet is a bit smoother than the Branca. Plus it’s local made (in Chicago) and has a nice bottle.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/letherbee-gin.png" alt="Letherbee Gin">
      <h2>Letherbee Gin</h2>
      <p>I love how extremely boring this label is. Letherbee makes really solid stuff. This is a great gin.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/lilet-blanc.png" alt="Lillet Blanc">
      <h2>Lillet Blanc</h2>
      <p>Sometimes I splash this in a gin martini to give it a bit more body. It’s also nice on ice.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/luxardo-maraschino.png" alt="Luxardo Maraschino">
      <h2>Luxardo Maraschino</h2>
      <p>Gotta have it for Manhattans. It’s extremely sweet, I’m not sure there's any other reason to have it. Cool weavy basket label though…</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/luxardo-maraschino-cherries.png" alt="Luxardo Maraschino Cherries">
      <h2>Luxardo Maraschino Cherries</h2>
      <p>Def one of the more delicious things you can put in your mouth. Typically a few are tossed into a Manhattan, but you can also eat them straight or stick em in other cocktails. The syrup is also perfect for a sinking deep red gradient in a light cocktail.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/malibu-rum.png" alt="Malibu Rum">
      <h2>Malibu Rum</h2>
      <p>I seriously don't even care. This tastes good with pineapple juice. You wanna sit on a beach? Drink it, done.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/meermaid-infused-rum.png" alt="Meermaid Infused Rum">
      <h2>Meermaid Infused Rum</h2>
      <p>Another one from the Craft Spirits festival in Berlin back in 2016. This one has a nice ceramic bottle, and the guy who sold it to me was a really nice tall fellow. Pretty balanced rum.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/meukow-vsop-superior.png" alt="Meukow V.S.O.P. Superior">
      <h2>Meukow V.S.O.P. Superior</h2>
      <p>This is the craziest bottle of liquor I’ve ever had in my collection. There’s a damn jaguar formed around the bottle. A good friend recommended it and it was great.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/mikkeller-spirits-botanical-gin.png" alt="Mikkeller Spirits Botanical Gin">
      <h2>Mikkeller Spirits Botanical Gin</h2>
      <p>This was a really junipery gin. And of course anything by Mikkeller is beautiful to have around. Nice for expressive gin cocktails.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/monkey-47-schwarzwald-gin.png" alt="Monkey 47 Schwarzwald Gin">
      <h2>Monkey 47 Schwarzwald Gin</h2>
      <p>I love this little apothecary-style bottle. It’s a beautiful bottle, cute size, and really solid gin. And made in Deutschland!</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/montenegro-amaro.png" alt="Montenegro amaro">
      <h2>Montenegro amaro</h2>
      <p>Can’t pass up this funky bottle. All amaros got freaky bottles with funky fonts.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/myerss-jamaica-rum.png" alt="Myers&#39;s Jamaica Rum">
      <h2>Myers&#39;s Jamaica Rum</h2>
      <p>Why are there even two S's in this? Ever notice that when you see this one on the shelf in every shitty bar? Bet not. I don't know why I have this one. I think I bought it before I knew what rum was.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/noahs-mill.png" alt="Noah’s Mill">
      <h2>Noah’s Mill</h2>
      <p>I was really excited about this one during a blind bourbon tasting. It turned out to rank low… which is strange because it’s expensive and highly reviewed. I need to try it again.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/noilly-prat.png" alt="Noilly Prat">
      <h2>Noilly Prat</h2>
      <p>Funny enough*, although I go for the Dolin Red for my sweet vermouth, I’ve always been stuck on Noilly Prat for my martinis.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/old-grand-dad.png" alt="Old Grand Dad">
      <h2>Old Grand Dad</h2>
      <p>Man that is a badass bottle I don’t care who ya are. Who makes a bright orange label with an orange cap? This is my standard drinkin’ whiskey. I always have a bottle. It’s super cheap and tastes great.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol-2018-6-7-penninger-blutwurz-black-edition/image-asset-91a66be3.png" alt="Penninger Blutwurz Black Edition">
      <h2>Penninger Blutwurz Black Edition</h2>
      <p>Another herbal liqueur. I bought this one at a craft spirits festival in Berlin. The bottle is ceramic, which is kinda cool. It’s like twee badass…</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/pimms-no-1.png" alt="Pimm’s No. 1">
      <h2>Pimm’s No. 1</h2>
      <p>I’m like still not really sure what Pimm’s is. It’s some British shit I think. I always thought it was an essential part of a complete bar, but I barely ever use it.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/pisco-barsol.png" alt="Pisco Barsol">
      <h2>Pisco Barsol</h2>
      <p>Everyone loves a Pisco Sour. It’s a classic.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/punt-e-mes.png" alt="Punt E Mes">
      <h2>Punt E Mes</h2>
      <p>This is an interesting option when you’re out of sweet vermouth. I mean it holds up on it’s own too, it’s nice to use, but somehow I’ve always just used it for a sweet vermouth sub.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/rakomelo.png" alt="Rakomelo">
      <h2>Rakomelo</h2>
      <p>I bought this at a Berlin Christmas Market one year. It tastes kind of like sweet tea… and thus tastes great in hot tea. 😏</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/ramazzotti.png" alt="Ramazzotti">
      <h2>Ramazzotti</h2>
      <p>In every bar, but a classic amaro. Tastes great in a mulled wine in winter.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/ratzeputz.png" alt="Ratzeputz">
      <h2>Ratzeputz</h2>
      <p>This is like top 5 favorite things to have in my bar y’all. It’s insanely high in alcohol content, and also is GINGER liqueur, so it burns extra extra hard. Fernet plus Ratzeputz sounds crazy but it’s a great cocktail.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/rowans-creek.png" alt="Rowan’s Creek">
      <h2>Rowan’s Creek</h2>
      <p>I saved this bottle for years and finally drank the thing after a rough time in my life. I think it tasted great…</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/satsuma-shiranami.png" alt="Satsuma Shiranami">
      <h2>Satsuma Shiranami</h2>
      <p>I do not know what this is, but a splash of it tastes great in a gin martini. It's also nice to just use as a vodka substitute when you want the flavor to be a little more funky.</p>
    </div>
<div class="collection-item">
<img src="/images/alcohol/smokecraft.png" alt="Smokecraft">
      <h2>Smokecraft</h2>
      <p>I will be very honest here. This one's a weirdo. I'm pretty sure it's not cool… Like no one likes fake smoke flavor pumped into stuff. That's basically what this is. I've had it for years and it's still half-full.&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>St. George Absinthe</h2>
      <p>Found this absinthe at a St. George tasting in Oakland. It’s solid.</p>

      <p>St. George makes magical spirits. This is a nice solid gin.</p>

      <h2>St. George Dry Rye</h2>
      <p>This is the most interesting gin I’ve ever tasted. I like having it on hand for a unconventional martini or just for sipping.</p>

      <h2>St. George Green Chile</h2>
      <p>I love St George so much. This vodka is absolutely delicious. It has a perfect chili pepper flavor. I don’t know why it looks like a dollar bill.</p>

      <h2>St. George Nola Coffee Liqueur</h2>
      <p>This stuff is straight up delicious. I love everything St. George does, and this is no exception. It's an excellent, dark, luscious liqueur.</p>

      <h2>St. George Terrior</h2>
      <p>The terrior from St. George is so wild. Like I almost don’t like it, it’s so botanical. It’s like eating pine tree needles. But it’s really well-made. Hard to mix, but fun.</p>

      <h2>Suze</h2>
      <p>I honestly have no idea what this really is. I bought it to make white negronis once (made with white vermouth, and Suze acting as the bitter). Handsome bottle.</p>

      <h2>Tanqueray No. Ten</h2>
      <p>Is this just repackaged Tanqueray? I dunno but the bottle is nice. At some point I decided it was my default gin to always have around. I think it’s a great neutral gin.</p>

      <h2>Tanqueray Sterling Vodka</h2>
      <p>I like Tanqueray, so I tried this vodka. It’s a good standard neutral vodka. The feel of the bottle is also really nice too—like velvet.</p>

      <h2>Three Sixty</h2>
      <p>Cheap vodka, good to have around for parties. Plus, the label is actual black velvet! Cute!</p>

      <p>I love this lil’ square bottle. And those big ol’ red letters. 👌</p>

      <h2>Żubrówka Bison Grass Flavoured Vodka</h2>
      <p>This is a funny vodka. I don't really understand the flavor. It's a bit sweet. Definitely drinkable alone. A friend brought it to my birthday party once. There's a real piece of grass inside it. Why?</p>
