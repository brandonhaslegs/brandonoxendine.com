        <p>
          We want droves of followers, we want to be featured on design blogs,
          we want to be idolized. But to what end? To be featured on the most
          blogs? To be listed on the most inspiration pages?
        </p>
        <p>
          What kind of community do we exist in where creating the best design
          and solving the hardest problems isn’t at the forefront of our minds?
          Being an influential, successful person is not about Twitter followers
          or blog features. I often wonder what the world was like before this
          culture of popularism began. Maybe it’s always been this way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currency is Twitter followers and Facebook fans. What would our world
          be like if follower counts weren’t public numbers, and your value was
          based on the content of your contributions and the quality of what you
          created rather than the number next to your name?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an issue of marketing. People with tremendous amounts of
          followers/fans are, to a certain extent, like any corporation with a
          large budget. It has the means to get its content out to the public,
          no matter what it is. This can be awesome. It can be used to raise
          awareness about disasters in the world; ways to help or support a
          cause. But largely, I’ve found, it is used to endlessly promote the
          ego and work of a designer. It’s not that promoting your work is a bad
          move, it’s just that it can get annoying really fast, and what’s the
          point of that?
        </p>
        <p>
          So, here’s a question for you, dear readers: Why are follower/fan
          counts public? What good does it do, and what would our community look
          like without them? Would we be better off?
        </p>
