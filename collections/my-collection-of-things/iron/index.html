<figcaption>I know I write this a lot, but it’s truly unbelievable how bad the market is for well-designed irons. It’s quite similar to the vacuum market, lots of ridiculous colors and 〽️ swooshes and bad plastics (as opposed to <a href="/things/hand-vacuum" target="_blank">good plastics</a>). I have luckily found an iron that looks pretty nice.</figcaption>
</figure><p>A few key things make this iron worth recommending:</p><ul><li><p>It’s made of this nice plastic that feels very soft to the touch, rather than shiny and sticky</p></li><li><p>It only has one color involved in the design (even the two other color options 🔴 🔵 are monochromatic)</p></li><li><p>The logo is nice, simple, and friendly</p></li><li><p>The cord is fabric-covered</p></li></ul>

  <p>It does suffer from some classic garbage design flaws (For some reason “BREEEZE” is printed on the bottom of it 🤷‍♂️) and those stupid icons permanently advertising its features even though you already own the thing. But I think it’s the least bad one.  Note: if you have 250 euro to spend on an iron, Morphy Richards has this <a href="http://amzn.to/2njE5IF" target="_blank">out of this world looking one</a> that I kind of love. 🇩🇪 <a href="http://amzn.to/2ofYOfz" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.de</a> 🇺🇸 <a href="http://amzn.to/2oLDcbB" target="_blank">This one is pretty similar on Amazon.com</a></p>
