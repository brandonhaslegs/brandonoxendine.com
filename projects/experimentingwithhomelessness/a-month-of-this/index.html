  <p>Day Thirty — Today is my one-month mark. I spent a week in New York staying with Samir and Nathan, (I consider that to go right along with my homeless lifestyle), and just got back from a 5-day trip back home, which was nothing like homelessness, but other than that and sleeping on James and Kelly’s couch once I’ve been sleeping in my car every night.</p><p>I’m pretty sure I could do this for as long as I want. It’s an odd feeling, but I don’t think anyone cares or notices that I’m at work literally 24 hours a day. And I’ve been thinking that I’m not so sure that’s against the rules. This comforts me.</p><p>When I got back from New York I realized I’d left an interior light on, so the car is now dead. I’m living in a dead car. Every once in a while I can get an interior light to stay on, but for the most part it’s dead. So I’ve gotta buy a battery-powered camping lamp. Should’ve done that a while ago, instead of draining the battery with the interior lights, but *live-n-lern*.</p><p>I passed a Volkswagon van a week or two ago on the street and was very interested in it. I didn’t know that those vans had so much interior storage and a table inside them. So I’m on the lookout for that. Also planning on buying a little scooter and putting a scooter-holder on the back of my car so I can use that to scoot around to do any quick trips. Driving the beast of a land-yacht gets tiresome. Plus, due to the nature of living in my car, it would be nice to just ride around on a scooter every once in a while so I don’t feel so contained.</p><p>Still haven’t figured out the charging-all-my-stuff situation. I really want to put solar panels on top of the car. Of course, being parked in a garage all the time isn’t going to help there. I mean, I am at work, so I just plug stuff in at my desk and rely on things to hold their charge through the night, but I’d really like to have a solution in the car so I can plug things in while I’m “at home.”</p><p>I really wish I could just tell people I’m homeless. Can’t homeless people have jobs? No? Why exactly do people need physical addresses anyway?</p>
