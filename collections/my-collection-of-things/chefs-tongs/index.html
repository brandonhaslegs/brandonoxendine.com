  <p>If you wanna feel hella fancy 👩‍🍳 while you cook, you need chef’s tongs. I use these for all kinds of cooking and grilling. If you haven’t cooked with tongs before, try it. It’s great to be able to turn, move, and flip things with precision.</p><p>These have a little hangy thing on the end just in case you like to hang things in your kitchen (I don’t hang everything, but I want all my utensils to be hangable, should I want to do a full hanging kitchen one day). They’re also quite long, which makes them feel extra ✨professional✨. The logo is fine… barely noticeable really. These are also the only chef’s tongs I could find that didn’t have a strange bulge in the middle. They’re quite straight.</p><p>🇺🇸 <a href="http://amzn.to/2oaituV" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.com</a></p><p>🇩🇪 <a href="http://amzn.to/2nadRTU" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.de</a></p>
