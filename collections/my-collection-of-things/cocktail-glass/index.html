  <p>I know there are a multitude of various good glassware 🍹 🍸 🍷 🥃 🥂 you can find, but I found these nice and simple. I fell in love with this style of cocktail glass (a coupe) when I started going to cocktail bars in San Francisco. They are nice and compact, less prone to splashing 💦 than martini glasses, and make any drink feel like a little 💎 precious thing. Turns out they’re just old-style champagne glasses. I’m sometimes tempted by vintage glassware, and I might try to find some at some point, but for now these are a great, simple styled coupe glass. I like to pour any drink served “up” into these.</p><p>Remember, I already wrote about the best tumblers or drinking glasses <a href="/things/9oz-candlefish-library-candles">here</a> (and I mean that, they are great).</p><p>🇺🇸 <a href="http://amzn.to/2nYo2jD" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.com</a> (approximately)</p><p>🇩🇪 <a href="http://amzn.to/2oDRZER" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.de</a></p><p>🇨🇦 <a href="http://amzn.to/2ojQ8Sz" target="_blank">Buy on Amazon.ca</a> (approximately)</p>
