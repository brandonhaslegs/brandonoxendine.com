          Illustrator a decade ago, read on:

        <section>
          <p>
            When I started at Fuzzco in June of last year, I was thrown into the
            mix as a designer and front-end developer. In the past, I worked
            under folks that used standard, tried-and-true methods of designing
            comps in Photoshop, saving out screens, getting approval, then
            moving to development—which is totally cool. Fuzzco operated very
            much like this, except for the not-so-minor detail that we designed
            websites in Illustrator. Cue uproar. Hear me out, I kicked and
            screamed for a while at first too.
          </p>
          <h2>Beginnings in Illustrator</h2>
          <p>
            <br />First, I should say Illustrator was my first love in design
            software. I enjoy and prefer working in Illustrator for its freeform
            object-based (as opposed to layer-based) method of layout. It feels
            more like real life to me—moving blocks around, putting things
            behind other things. I was not by a long shot an Illustrator hater
            when I showed up for work. But Illustrator is a vector drawing
            program, and, well, websites are made of pixels. Photoshop deals in
            pixels; it just made sense to translate pixels to pixels. That’s
            where the idea of designing for web in Illustrator broke down for
            me. Everyone is a pixel-perfectionist these days. It’s the standard,
            and it’s not that hard if you have a mind for details, but how could
            anyone even come close to being pixel-precise while wrangling
            vectors? Plus I totally designed my first few websites in
            Illustrator and that was when I was, like, a novice and stuff.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you ever go hang out at Fuzzco HQ for a bit, you’ll realize the
            way business goes down is akin to a fast-moving train with no end in
            sight. Designing websites in Photoshop just won’t fly. They work
            hard and fast and that calls for small incremental change rather
            than complete reversal of platforms in one day. No matter what I
            said about pixels to pixels and vectors to vectors, I had no choice
            but to design for web in Illustrator. It was a dilemma for me until
            I realized it was the best way to design for web in the crop of
            design tools that exist today.
          </p>
          <h2>Stick with me</h2>
          <h3>Pixel Preview</h3>
          <p>
            In order to design successfully in Illustrator, you must keep Pixel
            Preview turned on most of the time. If you don’t, you will end up
            with 1 pixel #000 lines that turn into 2 pixel fuzzy #999 lines and
            objects that hang around 200.358 pixels instead of 200 pixels.
            Precisely positioning objects is better off controlled with X and Y
            coordinates.
          </p>
          <h3>Workflow</h3>
          <p>
            Illustrator’s beautiful object-based workflow is a godsend. Unlike
            Photoshop’s shoot-me-in-the-face layer-based workflow, Illustrator
            allows for experimentation in the pasteboard (the area outside
            artboards), easy shape-making, and simple text box creation and
            manipulation. In fact, the most I use layers in Illustrator is to
            put backgrounds and other fixed elements in place and lock them.
          </p>
          <h3>Artboards</h3>
          <p>
            About artboards—they’re incredible. Artboards were introduced in CS4
            and are essentially multiple pages in a single document. When you
            save your file as a PDF, each artboard is saved as a separate page.
            Websites are made of pages, Illustrator allows for multiple
            artboards, which allows a designer to layout a whole website in one
            Illustrator file. Unlike Layer Comps in Photoshop (the most
            confusing feature ever), artboards are both easy to use and
            absolutely functional.
          </p>
          <h3>Infinite Scalability</h3>
          <p>
            When working on more holistic projects infinite scalability is
            invaluable. Since my work is not exclusively web-based, I tend to
            use parts of the website in future print materials. Say you’ve
            labored over a little ornamental detail on some part of a design
            that you want to make bigger at some point. In Photoshop, you’d
            import an object as a scalable vector, be able to re-size it and
            apply layer styles to it, but not much else. Heaven forbid you
            redraw it in pixels. This leaves you moving back and forth between
            two programs. Working in Illustrator, you’re able to take anything
            you’ve got going on and scale it, move it, rotate it, change it, and
            never worry about it becoming a blurry, scaled-up, steaming pile of
            crap.
          </p>
          <h3>Future Proof</h3>
          <p>
            Finally, using Illustrator on the web is future proof. Let’s face
            it: 72 DPI resolutions are going to be an archaic aspect of the web
            in 10 years. Probably less, I’m not well-versed on screen
            resolutions. We already cater to the 326 DPI, better-than-print
            resolution of the iPhone 4. I know that making a 27-inch retina
            display iMac would cost a small fortune right now, but remember when
            calculators were the size of city blocks and had million dollar
            price tags? Me neither, but I hear that was the way it was once.
          </p>
          <p>
            Point is, we’ll all be designing without any care for “pixel
            precision” some day in the future. Pixels will be a moot point.
            Designing for the screen will be just like designing for print. And
            thank God for that too. I can’t wait for the day that web design
            becomes more about design and less about how precise you can make
            your pixels look. All you designers touting pixel perfection, that
            ain’t what it’s about.
          </p>
          <h2>Alright, let’s bring it home</h2>
          <p>
            I know practically every web designer works in Photoshop, but let’s
            be real: Illustrator has a superior workflow, caters to page-based
            designing, and stands up against scale and time. With interesting
            discussions of what the best tool is for designing for the web

            So try it. It works. It converted a committed PSD-head to a
            full-time Illustrator junkie, and I’m confident it can do the same
            for you.
