        <p>2021 UPDATE:</p>
        <p>
          For my birthday this year my friends all pitched in to buy me a really
          nice Japanese chef knife which I love. I still use this knife though
          because it’s o comfortable to hold and has such a nice size.

            I’m constantly searching for good 🔪 knives that aren’t ugly.
            Currently I have Slitbar knives from IKEA. I know, whatever, but
            they’re alright and don’t look terrible. They’re no longer available
            from IKEA, which is a shame because I think they were the least-bad
            option there.
          </p>
          <p>
            But! I also have two all stainless steel MUJI knives (Now we’re
            friggin talkin) which I really love because 1) they are all
            stainless steel, 2) MUJI always makes super simple and quality
            products, and 3) they have nothing to gripe about design-wise. Also
            if you’re looking for more than a chef’s knife and a paring knife,
            you’re doing something wrong, friend. I use a chef’s knife 95% of
            the time.

          <p>
            PS: I’m always searching for a nice, beautiful, likely very
            expensive Japanese knife (you know the type). If anyone has a
            recommendation for a simple, beautiful one available on Amazon that
            they like, let me know! Ideally it would have some tite Japanese ㊙️
            inscribed on the sides and a really sexy damascus pattern on it.
