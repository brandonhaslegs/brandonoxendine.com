<h1>✷ fun—ding</h1><p>A hub for discovering grants and incubator programs. The idea is to collect all web3 grants on this site for people to have an overview of all the money that’s out there to be made. I named it. I think it’s pretty clear it’s a “fun thing” to discover funding.</p><pre><code>Role: UI, Branding, Naming</code></pre>

  <p>The landing page was a simple one just meant to grab attention and deliver a vibe that felt exciting while also giving people the opportunity to reach out to get involved.</p>

  <p>It’s a blocky, roundy app that is fun to look at and use but still prioritizes the most important and relevant information clearly.</p>

  <p>Twitter graphics play with the ratios of the display photo and make a layout that felt new even though it’s in a standard format that everyone is familiar with.</p>
