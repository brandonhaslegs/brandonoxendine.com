<h1>Startups get Grover&nbsp;</h1><p>Startups get Grover was an experimental offering from <a href="/grover">Grover</a> specifically targeting startups. This meant the website had to feel like something starting up, communicate use cases for small businesses that made it clear that Grover is a great option for small businesses who have limited capital, but big ideas.</p><pre><code>Role: UI, UX, Illustration, Concept, HTML, CSS</code></pre>

  <p>Before jumping into the design, I sketched out some rough ideas. This helped to understand what we wanted to communicate on the site, and give relevant stakeholders a quick idea of what might be on the site without yet getting stuck talking about details.</p>

  <p>We did a series of still lifes using stuff we found around the office to go with each of the use case pages. Each one was built around a specific theme that illustrated the use case.</p>

  <p>Here is an example of one of the use case pages. The idea here was to give startups ideas on how they could rent their tech with Grover. This particular use case covers how startups could rent the tech they typically would have to buy for a special party or event.</p>
